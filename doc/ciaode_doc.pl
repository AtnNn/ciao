:- doc(summary,

"The Ciao Development Enviroment (CiaoDE) is composed of three
packages: Ciao, CiaoPP and Lpdoc. Ciao provides a modern,
high-performance, @em{ISO-standard} Prolog system.  CiaoPP is the
precompiler of the Ciao Prolog development environment. CiaoPP can
perform a number of program debugging, analysis, and source-to-source
transformation tasks on (Ciao) Prolog programs. Lpdoc generates a
reference manual automatically from one or more source files for a
logic program (including ISO-Prolog, Ciao, many CLP systems, ...).").
