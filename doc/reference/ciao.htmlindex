<H1 class=appltitle><B class=applname>ciao:</B> <em>The Ciao Prolog System</em></H1>

 <p> <b>Ciao</b> is a <i>public domain</i> programming environment which supports the development and efficient compilation of <i>logic programs</i>, <i>constraint logic programs</i> (CLP), <i>functional logic programs</i>, and <i>object-oriented logic programs</i>. In particular, <b>Ciao</b> includes standard <b>ISO-Prolog</b> as a sublanguage and a program development environment similar to that of traditional Prolog and CLP implementations. However, <b>Ciao</b> extends the Prolog language and improves on traditional Prolog programming environments in a number of significant ways: <p><UL> 
<p><LI><b>Ciao</b> offers support for <i>programming in the large</i> with a robust module/object system, module-based automatic incremental compilation (with no need for makefiles), an assertion language for declaring (<i>optional</i>) program properties (including types and modes), automatic static inference and static/dynamic checking of such assertions, etc. <p><LI><b>Ciao</b> also offers support for <i>programming in the small</i> producing small executables (including only those builtins used by the program) and support for writing scripts in Prolog. <p><LI>The <b>Ciao</b> compiler generates several forms of architecture-independent and stand-alone executables. Library modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C source files, and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded. <p><LI><b>Ciao</b> supports concurrency (threads), distributed execution, and parallel execution. <p><LI>The <b>Ciao</b> programming environment includes a large number of <i>libraries</i> providing a wide range of additional functionality, from WWW programming to support for several control rules. <p><LI>The <b>Ciao</b> programming environment also includes <tt>lpdoc</tt>, a tool for generating documentation automatically for Prolog programs adorned with (<b>Ciao</b>) assertions and special, machine-readable comments. <p></UL> 
<p>The <b>Ciao</b> language has been designed from the ground up to be highly extensible (in a modular way) and to allow modular program development, global program analysis, and static debugging and optimization via source to source program transformation, including automatic parallelization. The latter tasks are performed by the <b>Ciao preprocessor</b> (<tt>ciaopp</tt>, distributed separately). The <b>Ciao</b> system also includes a rich <tt>emacs</tt> interface and a number of execution visualization tools. <p><b>Ciao</b> is distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2, as published by the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. <p>
