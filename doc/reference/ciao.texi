 @strong{Ciao} is a 
@coindex public domain
@glindex public domain
@emph{public domain}, @emph{next generation} multi-paradigm programming environment with a unique set of features: 




@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Ciao offers a complete Prolog system, supporting @emph{ISO-Prolog}, but its novel modular design allows both @emph{restricting} and @emph{extending} the language. As a result, it allows working with @emph{fully declarative subsets} of Prolog and also to @emph{extend} these subsets (or ISO-Prolog) both syntactically and semantically. Most importantly, these restrictions and extensions can be activated separately on each program module so that several extensions can coexist in the same application for different modules. 


@item Ciao also supports (through such extensions) programming with functions, higher-order (with predicate abstractions), constraints, and objects, as well as feature terms (records), persistence, several control rules (breadth-first search, iterative deepening, ...), concurrency (threads/engines), a good base for distributed execution (agents), and parallel execution. Libraries also support WWW programming, sockets, external interfaces (C, Java, TclTk, relational databases, etc.), etc. 


@item @strong{Ciao} offers support for @emph{programming in the large} with a robust module/object system, module-based separate/incremental compilation (automatically --no need for makefiles), an assertion language for declaring (@emph{optional}) program properties (including types and modes, but also determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc.), automatic static inference and static/dynamic checking of such assertions, etc. 


@item @strong{Ciao} also offers support for @emph{programming in the small} producing small executables (including only those builtins used by the program) and support for writing scripts in Prolog. 


@item The @strong{Ciao} programming environment includes a classical top-level and a rich emacs interface with an embeddable source-level debugger and a number of execution visualization tools. 


@item The @strong{Ciao} compiler (which can be run outside the top level shell) generates several forms of architecture-independent and stand-alone executables, which run with speed, efficiency and executable size which are very competitive with other commercial and academic Prolog/CLP systems. Library modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C source files, and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded. 


@item The novel modular design of Ciao enables, in addition to modular program development, effective global program analysis and static debugging and optimization via source to source program transformation. These tasks are performed by the @strong{Ciao preprocessor} (
@glindex ciaopp
@code{ciaopp}, distributed separately). 


@item The @strong{Ciao} programming environment also includes 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc}, an automatic documentation generator for LP/CLP programs. It processes Prolog files adorned with (@strong{Ciao}) assertions and machine-readable comments and generates manuals in many formats including @code{postscript}, @code{pdf}, @code{texinfo}, @code{info}, @code{HTML}, @code{man}, etc. , as well as on-line help, ascii @code{README} files, entries for indices of manuals (@code{info}, WWW, ...), and maintains WWW distribution sites.

@section About this manual 
@coindex status, this manual
@glindex status, this manual 

This is the @emph{Reference Manual} for the Ciao Prolog development system. It contains basic information on how to install Ciao Prolog and how to write, debug, and run Ciao Prolog programs from the command line, from inside GNU 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}, or from a windowing desktop. It also documents all the libraries available in the standard distribution. 

 This manual has been generated using the 
@coindex LPdoc
@glindex LPdoc
@emph{LPdoc} semi-automatic documentation generator for LP/CLP programs [HC97,Her00]. 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc} processes Prolog files (and files in other CLP languages) adorned with assertions and machine-readable comments, which should be written in the Ciao 
@glindex assertion language
assertion language [PBH97,PBH00]. From these, it generates manuals in many formats including @code{postscript}, @code{pdf}, @code{texinfo}, @code{info}, @code{HTML}, @code{man}, etc., as well as on-line help, ascii @code{README} files, entries for indices of manuals (@code{info}, WWW, ...), and maintains WWW distribution sites. 

The big advantage of this approach is that it is easier to keep the on-line and printed documentation in sync with the source code [Knu84]. As a result, @emph{this manual changes continually as the source code is modified}. Because of this, the manual has a version number. You should make sure the manual you are reading, whether it be printed or on-line, coincides with the version of the software that you are using. 

The approach also implies that there is often a variability in the degree to which different libraries or system components are documented. Many libraries offer abundant documentation, but a few will offer little. The latter is due to the fact that we tend to include libraries in the manual if the code is found to be useful, even if they may still contain sparse documentation. This is because including a library in the manual will at the bare minimum provide formal information (such as the names of exported predicates and their arity, which other modules it loads, etc.), create index entries, pointers for on-line help in the electronic versions of the manuals, and command-line completion capabilities inside 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}. Again, the manual is being updated continuously as the different libraries (and machine-readable documentation in them) are improved.

@coindex ciao, global description
@glindex ciao, global description 

 The Ciao system is a full programming environment for developing programs in the Prolog language and in several other languages which are extensions and modifications of Prolog in several interesting and useful directions. The programming environment offers a number of tools such as the Ciao standalone compiler (@code{ciaoc}), a traditional-style top-level interactive shell (@code{ciaosh} or @code{ciao}), an interpreter of scripts written in Prolog (@code{ciao-shell}), a Prolog @code{emacs} mode (which greatly helps the task of developing programs with support for editing, debugging, version/change tracking, etc.), numerous libraries, a powerful program preprocessor (@code{ciaopp} [BdlBH99,BLGPH04,HBPLG99], which supports static debugging and optimization from program analysis via source to source program transformation), and an automatic documentation generator (@code{lpdoc}) [HC97,Her00]. A number of execution visualization tools [CGH93,CH00d,CH00c] are also available. 

This manual documents the first four of the tools mentioned above [see PART I - The program development environment], and the Ciao Prolog language and libraries. The @code{ciaopp} and @code{lpdoc} tools are documented in separate manuals. 
 
The Ciao language [see PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)] has been designed from the ground up to be small, but to also allow extensions and restrictions in a modular way. The first objective allows producing small executables (including only those builtins used by the program), providing basic support for pure logic programming, and being able to write scripts in Prolog. The second one allows supporting standard ISO-Prolog [see PART III - ISO-Prolog library (iso)], as well as powerful extensions such as constraint logic programming, functional logic programming, and object-oriented logic programming [see PART VII - Ciao Prolog extensions], and restrictions such as working with pure horn clauses. 

The design of Ciao has also focused on allowing modular program development, as well as automatic program manipulation and optimization. Ciao includes a robust module system [CH00a], module-based automatic incremental compilation [CH99], and modular global program analysis, debugging and optimization [PH99], based on a rich assertion language [see PART V - Annotated Prolog library (assertions)] for declaring (optional) program properties (including types and modes), which can be checked either statically or dynamically. The program analysis, static debugging and optimization tasks related to these assertions are performed by the @code{ciaopp} preprocessor, as mentioned above. These assertions (together with special comment-style declarations) are also the ones used by the @code{lpdoc} autodocumenter to generate documentation for programs (the comment-style declarations are documented in the @code{lpdoc} manual). 

Ciao also includes several other features and utilities, such as support for several forms of executables, concurrency (threads), distributed and parallel execution, higher-order, WWW programming (PiLLoW [CHV96b]), interfaces to other languages like C and Java, database interfaces, graphical interfaces, etc., etc. [see PARTS VI to XI].

@section ISO-Prolog compliance versus extensibility 
@coindex iso-prolog, compliance
@glindex iso-prolog, compliance 
@coindex extensibility
@glindex extensibility 

 One of the innovative features of Ciao is that it has been designed to subsume 
@coindex ISO-Prolog
@glindex ISO-Prolog
@emph{ISO-Prolog} (International Standard ISO/IEC 13211-1, PROLOG: Part 1--General Core [DEDC96]), while at the same time extending it in many important ways. The intention is to ensure that all ISO-compliant Prolog programs run correctly under Ciao. At the same time, the Ciao module system (see [PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)] and [CH00a] for a discussion of the motivations behind the design) allows selectively avoiding the loading of most ISO-builtins (and changing some other ISO characteristics) when not needed, so that it is possible to work with purer subsets of Prolog and also to build small executables. Also, this module system makes it possible to develop extensions using these purer subsets (or even the full ISO-standard) as a starting point. Using these features, the Ciao distribution includes libraries which significantly extend the language both syntactically and semantically. 



Compliance with ISO is still not complete: currently there are some minor deviations in, e.g., the treatment of characters, the syntax, some of the arithmetic functions, and part of the error system. On the other hand, Ciao has been reported by independent sources (members of the standarization body) to be one of the most conforming Prologs at the moment of this writing, and the first one to be able to compile all the standard-conforming test cases. Also, Ciao does not offer a strictly conforming mode which rejects uses of non-ISO features. However, in order to aid programmers who wish to write standard compliant programs, library predicates that correspond to those in the ISO-Prolog standard are marked specially in the manuals, and differences between the Ciao and the prescribed ISO-Prolog behaviours, if any, are commented appropriately. 

The intention of the Ciao developers is to progressively complete the compliance of Ciao with the published parts of the ISO standard as well as with other reasonable extensions of the standard may be published in the future. However, since one of the design objectives of Ciao is to address some shortcomings of previous implementations of Prolog and logic programming in general, we also hope that some of the better ideas present in the system will make it eventually into the standards.

@glindex Ciao, why this name 

 After reading the previous sections the sharp reader may have already seen the logic behind the 'Ciao Prolog' name. Ciao is an interesting word which means both @emph{hello} and @emph{goodbye}. Ciao Prolog intends to be a really good, all-round, freely available ISO-Prolog system which can be used as a classical Prolog, in both academic and industrial environments (and, in particular, to introduce users to Prolog and to constraint and logic programming --the @emph{hello} part). But Ciao is also a new-generation, multiparadigm programming language and program development system which goes well beyond Prolog and other classical logic programming languages. And it has the advantage (when compared to other systems) that it does so while keeping full Prolog compatibility when needed.

 This manual is not meant to be an introduction to the Prolog language. The reader is referred to standard textbooks on Prolog such as [SS86,CM81,Apt97,Hog84]. However, we would like to refresh herein some concepts for the sake of establishing terminology. Also, we will briefly introduce a few of the extensions that Ciao brings to the Prolog language.

@subsection Predicates and their components 

In Prolog, procedures are called @emph{predicates} and predicate calls @emph{literals}. They all have the classical syntax of procedures (and of logic predications and of mathematical functions). Predicates are identified in this manual by a keyword 'PREDICATE' at the right margin of the place where they are documented. 

Prolog instructions are expressions made up of control constructs (@ref{Control constructs/predicates}) and literals, and are called @emph{goals}. Literals are also (atomic) goals. 

A predicate definition is a sequence of clauses. A clause has the form ``@code{H :- B.}'' (ending in '@code{.}'), where @code{H} is syntactically the same as a literal and is called the clause @emph{head}, and @code{B} is a goal and is called the clause @emph{body}. A clause with no body is written ``@code{H.}'' and is called a @emph{fact}. Clauses with body are also called @emph{rules}. A Prolog program is a sequence of predicate definitions. 



@node Characters and character strings, Predicate specs, Predicates and their components, Syntax terminology and notational conventions
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Characters and character strings 

We adopt the following convention for delineating character strings in the text of this manual: when a string is being used as a Prolog atom it is written thus: @code{user} or @code{'user'}; but in all other circumstances double quotes are used (as in @code{"hello"}). 


@coindex keyboard
@glindex keyboard 
When referring to keyboard characters, printing characters are written thus: @key{a}, while control characters are written like this: @key{^A}. Thus @key{^C} is the character you get by holding down the @key{CTL} key while you type @key{c}. Finally, the special control characters carriage-return, line-feed and space are often abbreviated to @key{RET}, @key{LFD} and @key{SPC} respectively. 



@node Predicate specs, Modes, Characters and character strings, Syntax terminology and notational conventions
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Predicate specs 

Predicates in Prolog are distinguished by their name @emph{and} their arity. We will call @code{name/arity} a 
@glindex @emph{predicate spec}
@emph{predicate spec}. The notation @code{name/arity} is therefore used when it is necessary to refer to a predicate unambiguously. For example, @code{concatenate/3} specifies the predicate which is named ``concatenate'' and which takes 3 arguments. 

(Note that different predicates may have the same name and different arity. Conversely, of course, they may have the same arity and different name.) 



@node Modes, Properties and types, Predicate specs, Syntax terminology and notational conventions
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Modes 

When documenting a predicate, we will often describe its usage with a 
@glindex mode spec
mode spec which has the form @code{name(Arg1, ..., ArgN)} where each @code{Arg} may be preceded by a 
@glindex @emph{mode}
@emph{mode}. A mode is a functor which is wrapped around an argument (or prepended if defined as an operator). Such a mode allows documenting in a compact way the 
@glindex instantiation state
instantiation state on call and exit of the argument to which it is applied. The set of modes which can be used in Ciao is not fixed. Instead, arbitrary modes can be defined by in programs using the 
@glindex modedef/1
@code{modedef/1} declarations of the Ciao 
@glindex @emph{assertion language}
@emph{assertion language} (@ref{The Ciao assertion package} for details). Modes are identified in this manual by a keyword 'MODE'. 

Herein, we will use the set of modes defined in the Ciao 
@glindex isomodes
@code{isomodes} library, which is essentially the same as those used in the 
@glindex ISO-Prolog
ISO-Prolog standard (@ref{ISO-Prolog modes}). 



@node Properties and types, Declarations, Modes, Syntax terminology and notational conventions
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Properties and types 

Although Ciao Prolog is @emph{not} a typed language, it allows writing (and using) types, as well as (more general) properties. There may be properties of the states and of the computation. Properties of the states allow expressing characteristics of the program variables during computation, like in @code{sorted(X)} (@code{X} is a sorted list). Properties of the computation allow expressing characteristics of a whole computation, like in @code{is_det(p(X,Y))} (such calls yield only one solution). Properties are just a special form of predicates (@ref{Declaring regular types}) and are identified in this manual by a keyword 'PROPERTY'. 

Ciao types are @emph{regular types} (@ref{Declaring regular types}), which are a special form of properties themselves. They are identified in this manual by a keyword 'REGTYPE'. 



@node Declarations, Operators, Properties and types, Syntax terminology and notational conventions
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Declarations 

A @emph{declaration} provides information to one of the Ciao environment tools. Declarations are interspersed in the code of a program. Usually the target tool is either the compiler (telling it that a predicate is dynamic, or a meta-predicate, etc.), the preprocessor (which understands declarations of properties and types, assertions, etc.), or the autodocumenter (which understands the previous declarations and also certain ``comment'' declarations). 

A declaration has the form @code{:- D.} where @code{D} is syntactically the same as a literal. Declarations are identified in this manual by a keyword 'DECLARATION'. 

In Ciao users can define (and document) new declarations. New declarations are typically useful when defining extensions to the language (which in Ciao are called packages). Such extensions are often implemented as 
@glindex expansions
expansions (see @ref{Extending the syntax}). There are many such extensions in Ciao. The 
@glindex functions
@code{functions} library, which provides fuctional syntax, is an example. The fact that in Ciao expansions are local to modules (as operators, see below) makes it possible to use a certain language extension in one module without affecting other modules. 



@node Operators,  , Declarations, Syntax terminology and notational conventions
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Operators 

An @emph{operator} is a functor (or predicate name) which has been declared as such, thus allowing its use in a prefix, infix, or suffix fashion, instead of the standard procedure-like fashion. E.g., declaring @code{+} as an infix operator allows writing @code{X+Y} instead of @code{'+'(X,Y)} (which may still, of course, be written). 

@emph{Operators in Ciao are local to the module/file where they are declared}. However, some operators are standard and allowed in every program (see @ref{Defining operators}). This manual documents the operator declarations in each (library) module where they are included. As with expansions, the fact that in Ciao operators are local to modules makes it possible to use a certain language extension in one module without affecting other modules.

This part documents the components of the basic Ciao program development environment. They include: 


@table @asis 


@item ciaoc: 
the standalone compiler, which creates executables without having to enter the interactive top-level.

@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}, as is done in other Prolog systems. However, it is also @emph{embeddable}, in the sense that it can be included as a library in executables, and activated dynamically and conditionally while such executables are running. 


@item ciao-shell: 
an interpreter/compiler for @emph{Prolog scripts} (i.e., files containing Prolog code which run without needing explicit compilation).

@coindex programming environment
@glindex programming environment 
on 
@glindex GNU emacs
GNU emacs, with syntax coloring, direct access to all the tools described above (as well as the preprocessor and the documenter), atomatic location of errors, source-level debugging, context-sensitive access to on-line help/manuals, etc. The use of this environment is @emph{very highly recommended}!

@item Version 1.9 (2002/5/16, 23:17:34 CEST)
 New development version after stable 1.8p0 (MCL, DCG)

@item Version 1.8 (2002/5/16, 21:20:27 CEST)
 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Improvements related to supported platforms: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Support for Mac OS X 10.1, based on the Darwin kernel. 
@item Initial support for compilation on Linux for Power PC (contributed by 
@coindex Paulo Moura
@glindex Paulo Moura
@emph{Paulo Moura}). 
@item Workaround for incorrect C compilation while using newer (> 2.95) gcc compilers. 
@item .bat files generated in Windows. 
@end itemize  


@item Changes in compiler behavior and user interface: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Corrected a bug which caused wrong code generation in some cases. 
@item Changed execution of initialization directives. Now the initialization of a module/file never runs before the initializations of the modules from which the module/file imports (excluding circular dependences). 
@item The engine is more intelligent when looking for an engine to execute bytecode; this caters for a variety of situations when setting explicitly the CIAOLIB environment variable. 
@item Fixed bugs in the toplevel: behaviour of @code{module:main} calls and initialization of a module (now happens after related modules are loaded). 
@item Layout char not needed any more to end Prolog files. 
@item Syntax errors now disable .itf creation, so that they show next time the code is used without change. 
@item Redefinition warnings now issued only when an unqualified call is seen. 
@item Context menu in Windows can now load a file into the toplevel. 
@item Updated Windows installation in order to run CGI executables under Windows: a new information item is added to the registry. 
@item Added new directories found in recent Linux distributions to INFOPATH. 


@item Emacs-based environment and debugger improved: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Errors located immediataly after code loading. 
@item Improved ciao-check-types-modes (preprocessor progress now visible). 
@item Fixed loading regions repeatedly (no more predicate redefinition warnings). 
@item Added entries in 
@glindex ciaopp
@code{ciaopp} menu to set verbosity of output. 
@item Fixed some additional xemacs compatibility issues (related to searches). 
@item Errors reported by inferior processes are now explored in forward order (i.e., the first error rewported is the first one highlighted). Improved tracking of errors. 
@item Specific tool bar now available, with icons for main fuctions (works from emacs 21.1 on). Also, other minor adaptations for working with emacs 21.1 and later. 
@item Debugger faces are now locally defined (and better customization). This also improves comtability with xemacs (which has different faces). 
@item Direct access to a common use of the preprocessor (checking modes/types and locating errors) from toolbar. 
@item Inferior modes for Ciao and CiaoPP improved: contextual help turned on by default. 
@item Fixes to set-query. Also, previous query now appears in prompt. 
@item Improved behaviour of stored query. 
@item Improved behaviour of recentering, finding errors, etc. 
@item Wait for prompt has better termination characteristics. 
@item Added new interactive entry points (M-x): ciao, prolog, ciaopp. 
@item Better tracking of last inferior buffer used. 
@item Miscellanous bugs removed; some colors changed to adapt to different Emacs versions. 
@item Fixed some remaining incompatibilities with xemacs. 
@item @code{:- doc} now also supported and highlighted. 
@item Eliminated need for calendar.el 
@item Added some missing library directives to fontlock list, organized this better. 
@end itemize  


@end itemize  


@item New libraries added to the system: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item hiord: new library which needs to be loaded in order to use higher-order call/N and P(X) syntax. Improved model for predicate abstractions. 
@item fuzzy: allows representing fuzzy information in the form or Prolog rules. 
@item use_url: allows loading a module remotely by using a WWW address of the module source code 
@item andorra: alternative search method where goals which become deterministic at run time are executed before others. 
@item iterative deepening (id): alternative search method which makes a depth-first search until a predetermined depth is reached. Complete but in general cheaper than breadth first. 
@item det_hook: allows making actions when a deterministic situation is reached. 
@item ProVRML: read VRML code and translate it into Prolog terms, and the other way around. 
@item io_alias_redirection: change where stdin/stdout/stderr point to from within Ciao Prolog programs. 
@item tcl_tk: an interface to Tcl/Tk programs. 
@item tcl_tk_obj: object-based interface to Tcl/Tk graphical objects. 
@item CiaoPP: options to interface with the CiaoPP Prolog preprocessor. 
@end itemize  


@item Some libraries greatly improved: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item WebDB: utilities to create WWW-based database interfaces. 
@item Improved java interface implementation (this forced renaming some interface primitives). 
@item User-transparent persistent predicate database revamped: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Implemented passerta_fact/1 (asserta_fact/1). 


@item Now it is never necessary to explicitly call init_persdb, a call to initialize_db is only needed after dynamically defining facts of persistent_dir/2. Thus, pcurrent_fact/1 predicate eliminated. 


@item Facts of persistent predicates included in the program code are now included in the persistent database when it is created. They are ignored in successive executions. 


@item Files where persistent predicates reside are now created inside a directory named as the module where the persistent predicates are defined, and are named as F_A* for predicate F/A. 


@item Now there are two packages: persdb and 'persdb/ll' (for low level). In the first, the standard builtins asserta_fact/1, assertz_fact/1, and retract_fact/1 are replaced by new versions which handle persistent data predicates, behaving as usual for normal data predicates. In the second package, predicates with names starting with 'p' are defined, so that there is not overhead in calling the standard builtins. 


@item Needed declarations for persistent_dir/2 are now included in the packages. 
@end itemize  


@item SQL now works with mysql. 
@item system: expanded to contain more predicates which act as interface to the underlying system / operating system. 
@end itemize  


@item Other libraries improved: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item xref: creates cross-references among Prolog files. 
@item concurrency: new predicates to create new concurrent predicates on-the-fly. 
@item sockets: bugs corrected. 
@item objects: concurrent facts now properly recognized. 
@item fast read/write: bugs corrected. 
@item Added 'webbased' protocol for active modules: publication of active module address can now be made through WWW. 
@item Predicates in library(dynmods) moved to library(compiler). 
@item Expansion and meta predicates improved. 
@item Pretty printing. 
@item Assertion processing. 
@item Module-qualified function calls expansion improved.

@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Added a prolog_flag to retrieve the version and patch. 
@item current_predicate/1 in library(dynamic) now enumerates non-engine modules, prolog_sys:current_predicate/2 no longer exists. 
@item exec/* bug fixed. 
@item srandom/1 bug fixed. 
@end itemize  


@item Updates for C interface: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Fixed bugs in already existing code. 
@item Added support for creation and traversing of Prolog data structures from C predicates. 
@item Added support for raising Prolog exceptions from C predicates.

This part guides you through some very basic first steps with Ciao on a Un*x-like system. It assumes that Ciao is already installed correctly on your Un*x system. If this is not the case, then follow the instructions in @ref{Installing Ciao from the source distribution} first. 

We start with by describing the basics of using Ciao from a normal command shell such as @code{sh/bash}, @code{csh/tcsh}, etc. We strongly recommend reading also @ref{An introduction to the Ciao emacs environment (Un*x)} for the basics on using Ciao under 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}, which is a much simpler and much more powerful way of developing Ciao programs, and has the advantage of offering an almost identical environment under Un*x and Windows.

@section Testing your Ciao Un*x installation 


@noindent
It is a good idea to start by performing some tests to check that Ciao is installed correctly on your system (these are the same tests that you are instructed to do during installation, so you can obviously skip them if you have done them already at that time). If any of these tests do not succeed either your environment variables are not set properly (see @ref{Un*x user setup} for how to fix this): 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Typing 
@glindex ciao
@code{ciao} (or 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}) should start the typical Prolog top-level shell. 


@item In the top-level shell, Prolog library modules should load correctly. Type for example @code{use_module(library(dec10_io))} --you should get back a prompt with no errors reported. 




@item To exit the top level shell, type @code{halt.} as usual, or @key{^D}. 


@item Typing 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} should produce the help message from the Ciao 
@glindex standalone compiler
standalone compiler. 


@item Typing 
@glindex ciao-shell
@code{ciao-shell} should produce a message saying that no code was found. This is a Ciao application which can be used to write 
@glindex scripts
scripts written in Prolog, i.e., files which do not need any explicit compilation to be run. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
Also, the following documentation-related actions should work: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If the 
@glindex info

If the tests above have succeeded, the system is probably installed correctly and your environment variables have been set already. In that case you can skip to the next section. 

Otherwise, if you have not already done so, make the following modifications in your startup scripts, so that these files are used (@code{<LIBROOT>} must be replaced with the appropriate value, i.e., where the Ciao library is installed): 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item For users a

@code{~/.cshrc}: 


@smallexample 
        if ( -e <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc ) then
           source <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc
        endif
@end smallexample  


@glindex Mac OS X
@code{Mac OS X} users should add (or modify) the 
@glindex path
@code{path} file in the directory @code{~/Library/init/tcsh}, adding the lines shown above. @strong{Note:} while this is recognized by the terminal shell, and therefore by the text-mode Emacs which comes with Mac OS X, the Aqua native Emacs 21 does not recognize that initialization. It is thus necessary, at this moment, to set manually the Ciao shell (ciaosh) and Ciao library location by hand. This can be done from the Ciao menu within Emacs after a Ciao Prolog file has been loaded. We suppose that the reason is that Mac OS X does not actually consult the per-user initialization files on startup. It should also be possible to put the right initializations in the .emacs file using the @code{setenv} function of Emacs-lisp, as in 


@smallexample 
(setenv "CIAOLIB" "<LIBROOT>/ciao")
@end smallexample  

The same can be done for the rest of the variables initialized in @code{<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc} 
 


@item For users of an 
@coindex sh-compatible shell
@glindex sh-compatible shell
@emph{sh-compatible shell} (

@smallexample 
        if [ -f <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile ]; then
           . <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile
        fi
@end smallexample  

This will set up things so that the Ciao executables are found and you can access the Ciao system manuals using the 
@glindex info
@code{info} command. Note that, depending on your shell, @emph{you may have to log out and back in} for the changes to take effect. 


@item Also, if you use 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} (highly recommended) add this line to your 
@glindex ~/.emacs
@code{~/.emacs} file: 


@smallexample 
        (load-file "<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTemacs.el")
@end smallexample  


@end itemize  
 


If after following these steps things do not work properly, then the installation was probably not completed properly and you may want to try reinstalling the system.

@glindex running programs 

Once the shell is started, you can compile and execute Prolog modules inside the interactive top-level shell in the standard way. E.g., type @code{use_module(@emph{file}).}, @code{use_module(library(@emph{file})).} for library modules, @code{ensure_loaded(@emph{file}).} for files which are not modules, and @code{use_package(@emph{file}).} for library packages (these are syntactic/semantic packages that extend the Ciao Prolog language in many different ways). Note that the use of 
@glindex compile/1
@code{compile/1} and 
@glindex consult/1
@code{consult/1} is discouraged in Ciao. 

For example, you may want to type @code{use_package(iso)} to ensure Ciao has loaded all the ISO builtins (whether this is done by default or not depends on your 
@glindex .ciaorc
@code{.ciaorc} file). Do not worry about any ``module already in executable'' messages --these are normal and simply mean that a certain module is already pre-loaded in the top-level shell. At this point, typing @code{write(hello).} should work. 

Note that some predicates that may be built-ins in other Prologs are available through libraries in Ciao. This facilitates making small executables. 

To change the working directory to, say, the @code{examples} directory in the Ciao root directory, first do: 


@smallexample 
      ?- use_module(library(system)).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
(loading the 
@glindex system
@code{system} library makes a number of system-related predicates such as 
@glindex cd/1
@code{cd/1} accessible) and then: 


@smallexample 
      ?- cd('$/examples').  
@end smallexample  


@noindent
(in Ciao the sequence @code{$/} @emph{at the beginning of a path name} is replaced by the path of the Ciao root directory).

Executables can be generated from the top-level shell (using 
@glindex make_exec/2
@code{make_exec/2}) or using the standalone compiler (
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}). To be able to make an executable, the file should define the predicate 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} (or 
@glindex main/0
@code{main/0}), which will be called upon startup (see the corresponding manual section for details). In its simplest use, given a top-level @emph{foo}@code{.pl} file for an application, the compilation process produces an executable @code{foo}, automatically detecting which other files used by @code{foo.pl} need recompilation. 


@noindent
For example, within the 
@glindex examples
@code{examples} directory, you can type: 


@smallexample 
    ?- make_exec(hw,_).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
which should produce an executable. Typing @code{hw} in a shell (or double-clicking on the icon from a graphical window) should execute it. 

For more information see @ref{The interactive top-level shell} and @ref{The stand-alone command-line compiler}.

Ciao allows writing 
@glindex Prolog scripts
Prolog scripts. These are files containing Prolog source but which get executed without having to explicitly compile them (in the same way as, e.g., @code{.bat} files or programs in scripting languages). As an example, you can run the file 
@glindex hw
@code{hw} in the 
@glindex examples
@code{examples} directory of the Ciao distribution and look at the source with an editor. You can try changing the @code{Hello world} message and running the program again (no need to recompile!). 

As you can see, the file should define the predicate 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} (not 
@glindex main/0
@code{main/0}), which will be called upon startup. The two header lines are necessary in Un*x in. In Windows you can leave them in or you can take them out, but you need to rename the script to 
@glindex hw.pls
@code{hw.pls}. Leaving the lines in has the advantage that the script will also work in Un*x without any change.

@glindex .ciaorc
@code{.ciaorc} and placed in your @emph{home} directory (e.g., @code{~}, the same in which the 
@glindex .emacs
@code{.emacs} file is put). You may need to set the environment variable @code{HOME} to the path of this directory for the Ciao toplevel shell to be able to locate this file on startup.

@section An introduction to the Ciao emacs environment (Un*x) 

 
@coindex emacs, intro
@glindex emacs, intro 
While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, using it within the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/program development system is highly recommended: Ciao includes an 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} @emph{mode} which provides a very complete 
@coindex development environment
@glindex development environment 
@emph{application development environment} which greatly simplifies many program development tasks. See @ref{Using Ciao inside GNU emacs} for details on the capabilities of 
@glindex ciao
@code{ciao}/
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} combination. 

If the (freely available) 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/environment is not installed in your system, we highly recommend that you also install it at this point (there are instructions for where to find 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} and how to install it in the Ciao installation instructions). After having done this you can try for example the following things: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item A few basic things: 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Typing @key{^H} @key{i} (or in the menus @code{Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals with Info}) should open a list of manuals in info format in which the Ciao manual(s) should appear. 


@item When opening a Prolog file, i.e., a file with @code{.pl} or @code{.pls} ending, using @key{^X}@key{^F}@code{filename} (or using the menus) the code should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g., comments in red), and @code{Ciao/Prolog} menus should appear in the menu bar on top of the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} window. 


@item Loading the file using the @code{Ciao/Prolog} menu (or typing @key{^C} @key{l}) should start in another emacs buffer the Ciao toplevel shell and load the file. You should now be able to switch the the toplevel shell and make queries from within 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
@strong{Note:} when using 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} it is @emph{very convenient} to swap the locations of the (normally not very useful) @key{Caps Lock} key and the (very useful in 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}) @key{Ctrl} key on the keyboard. How to do this is explained in the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} frequently asked questions FAQs (see the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} download instructions for their location). 



(if these things do not work the system or emacs may not be installed properly). 


@item You can go to the location of most of the errors that may be reported during compilation by typing @key{^C} @key{`}. 


@item You can also, e.g., create executables from the @code{Ciao/Prolog} menu, as well as compile individual files, or generate active modules. 


@item Loading a file for source-level debugging using the @code{Ciao/Prolog} menu (or typing @key{^C} @key{d}) and then issuing a query should start the source-level debugger and move a marker on the code in a window while execution is stepped through in the window running the Ciao top level. 


@item You can add the lines needed in Un*x for turning any file defining 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} into a script from the Ciao/Prolog menu or by typing @key{^C} @key{I} @key{S}. 


@item You can also work with the preprocessor and auto-documenter directly from emacs: see their manuals or browse through the corresponding menus that appear when editing @code{.pl} files.

This part guides you through some very basic first steps with Ciao on an MSWindows (``Win32'') system. It assumes that Ciao is already installed correctly on your Windows system. If this is not the case, then follow the instructions in @ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution} (or @ref{Installing Ciao from the source distribution}) first. 

We start with by describing the basics of using Ciao from the Windows explorer and/or a DOS command shell. We strongly recommend reading also @ref{An introduction to the Ciao emacs environment (Win32)} for the basics on using Ciao under 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}, which is a much simpler and much more powerful way of developing Ciao programs, and has the advantage of offering an almost identical environment under Windows and Un*x.

@noindent
It is a good idea to start by performing some tests to check that Ciao is installed correctly on your system (these are the same tests that you are instructed to do during installation, so you can obviously skip them if you have done them already at that time): 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Ciao-related file types (@code{.pl} source files, @code{.cpx} executables, @code{.itf,.po,.asr} interface files, @code{.pls} scripts, etc.) should have specific icons associated with them (you can look at the files in the folders in the Ciao distribution to check). 


@item Double-clicking on the shortcut to 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}(@code{.cpx}) on the desktop should start the typical Prolog top-level shell in a window. If this shortcut has not been created on the desktop, then double-clicking on the 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}(@code{.cpx}) icon inside the @code{shell} folder within the Ciao source folder should have the same effect. 


@item In the top-level shell, Prolog library modules should load correctly. Type for example @code{use_module(library(dec10_io)).} at the Ciao top-level prompt --you should get back a prompt with no errors reported. 


@item To exit the top level shell, type @code{halt.} as usual, or @key{^D}. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
Also, the following documentation-related actions should work: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Double-clicking on the shortcut to @code{ciao}(@code{.html}) which appears on the desktop should show the Ciao manual in your default WWW browser. If this shortcut has not been created you can double-click on the @code{ciao}(@code{.html}) file in the @code{doc\reference\ciao_html} folder inside the Ciao source folder. Make sure you configure your browser to use 
@coindex style sheets
@glindex style sheets

Once the shell is started, you can compile and execute Prolog modules inside the interactive toplevel shell in the standard way. E.g., type @code{use_module(@emph{file}).}, @code{use_module(library(@emph{file})).} for library modules, @code{ensure_loaded(@emph{file}).} for files which are not modules, and @code{use_package(@emph{file}).} for library packages (these are syntactic/semantic packages that extend the Ciao Prolog language in many different ways). Note that the use of 
@glindex compile/1
@code{compile/1} and 
@glindex consult/1
@code{consult/1} is discouraged in Ciao. 

For example, you may want to type @code{use_package(iso)} to ensure Ciao has loaded all the ISO builtins (whether this is done by default or not depends on your 
@glindex .ciaorc
@code{.ciaorc} file). Do not worry about any ``module already in executable'' messages --these are normal and simply mean that a certain module is already pre-loaded in the toplevel shell. At this point, typing @code{write(hello).} should work. 

Note that some predicates that may be built-ins in other Prologs are available through libraries in Ciao. This facilitates making small executables. 

To change the working directory to, say, the @code{examples} directory in the Ciao source directory, first do: 


@smallexample 
      ?- use_module(library(system)).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
(loading the 
@glindex system
@code{system} library makes a number of system-related predicates such as 
@glindex cd/1
@code{cd/1} accessible) and then: 


@smallexample 
      ?- cd('$/examples').  
@end smallexample

(in Ciao the sequence @code{$/} @emph{at the beginning of a path name} is replaced by the path of the Ciao root directory).

Executables can be generated from the toplevel shell (using 
@glindex make_exec/2
@code{make_exec/2}) or using the standalone compiler (
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}(@code{.cpx}), located in the @code{ciaoc} folder). To be able to make an executable, the file should define the predicate 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} (or 
@glindex main/0
@code{main/0}), which will be called upon startup (see the corresponding manual section for details). 


@noindent
For example, within the 
@glindex examples
@code{examples} directory, you can type: 


@smallexample 
    ?- make_exec(hw,_).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
which should produce an executable. Double-clicking on this executable should execute it. 

Another way of creating Ciao executables from source files is by right-clicking on @code{.pl} files and choosing ``make executable''. This uses the standalone compiler (this has the disadvantage, however, that it is sometimes difficult to see the error messages). 

For more information see @ref{The interactive top-level shell} and @ref{The stand-alone command-line compiler}.

Double-clicking on files ending in @code{.pls}, @emph{Ciao Prolog scripts}, will also execute them. These are files containing Prolog source but which get executed without having to explicitly compile them (in the same way as, e.g., @code{.bat} files or programs in scripting languages). As an example, you can double-click on the file 
@glindex hw.pls
@code{hw.pls} in the 
@glindex examples
@code{examples} folder and look at the source with an editor. You can try changing the @code{Hello world} message and double-clicking again (no need to recompile!). 

As you can see, the file should define the predicate 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} (not 
@glindex main/0
@code{main/0}), which will be called upon startup. The two header lines are only necessary in Un*x. In Windows you can leave them in or you can take them out, but leaving them in has the advantage that the script will also work in Un*x without any change.

@section An introduction to the Ciao emacs environment (Win32) 

 
@coindex emacs, intro
@glindex emacs, intro 
While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, using it within the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/program development system is highly recommended: Ciao includes an 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} @emph{mode} which provides a very complete 
@coindex development environment
@glindex development environment 
@emph{application development environment} which greatly simplifies many program development tasks. See @ref{Using Ciao inside GNU emacs} for details on the capabilities of 
@glindex ciao
@code{ciao}/
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} combination. 

If the (freely available) 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/environment is not installed in your system, we highly recommend that you also install it at this point (there are instructions for where to find 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} and how to install it in the Ciao installation instructions). After having done this you can try for example the following things: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item A few basic things: 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Typing @key{^H} @key{i} (or in the menus @code{Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals with Info}) should open a list of manuals in info format in which the Ciao manual(s) should appear. 


@item When opening a Prolog file, i.e., a file with @code{.pl} or @code{.pls} ending, using @key{^X}@key{^F}@code{filename} (or using the menus) the code should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g., comments in red), and @code{Ciao/Prolog} menus should appear in the menu bar on top of the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} window. 


@item Loading the file using the @code{Ciao/Prolog} menu (or typing @key{^C} @key{l}) should start in another emacs buffer the Ciao toplevel shell and load the file. You should now be able to switch the the toplevel shell and make queries from within 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
@strong{Note:} when using 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} it is @emph{very convenient} to swap the locations of the (normally not very useful) @key{Caps Lock} key and the (very useful in 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}) @key{Ctrl} key on the keyboard. How to do this is explained in the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} frequently asked questions FAQs (see the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} download instructions for their location). 



(if these things do not work the system or emacs may not be installed properly). 


@item You can go to the location of most of the errors that may be reported during compilation by typing @key{^C} @key{`}. 


@item You can also, e.g., create executables from the @code{Ciao/Prolog} menu, as well as compile individual files, or generate active modules. 


@item Loading a file for source-level debugging using the @code{Ciao/Prolog} menu (or typing @key{^C} @key{d}) and then issuing a query should start the source-level debugger and move a marker on the code in a window while execution is stepped through in the window running the Ciao top level. 


@item You can add the lines needed in Un*x for turning any file defining 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} into a script from the Ciao/Prolog menu or by typing @key{^C} @key{I} @key{S}. 


@item You can also work with the preprocessor and auto-documenter directly from emacs: see their manuals or browse through the corresponding menus that appear when editing @code{.pl} files. 


@end itemize  

We encourage you once more to read @ref{Using Ciao inside GNU emacs} to discover the many other functionalities of this environment.

@section Introduction to building executables 

An 
@coindex executable
@glindex executable
@emph{executable} can be built from a single file or from a collection of inter-related files. In the case of only one file, this file must define the predicate 
@glindex main/0
@code{main/0} or 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1}. This predicate is the one which will be called when the executable is started. As an example, consider the following file, called @code{hello.pl}: 


@smallexample 
main :-
     write('Hello world'), 
     nl.
@end smallexample  


@noindent
To compile it from the command line using the 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} standalone compiler it suffices to type ``@code{ciaoc hello}'' (in Win32 you may have to put the complete path to the 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} folder of the Ciao distribution, where the installation process leaves a 
@glindex ciaoc.bat
@code{ciaoc.bat} file): 


@smallexample 
/herme@@clip:/tmp
[60]> ciaoc hello

/herme@@clip:/tmp
[61]> 
@end smallexample  


@noindent
This produces an executable called @code{hello} in Un*x-like systems and @code{hello.cpx} under Win32 systems. This executable can then be run in Win32 by double-clicking on it and on Un*x systems by simply typing its name (see for @ref{Running executables from the command line} for how to run executables from the command line in Win32): 


@smallexample 
/herme@@clip:/tmp
[61]> hello
Hello world

@end smallexample  

If the application is composed of several files the process is identical. Assume @code{hello.pl} is now: 


@smallexample 
:- use_module(aux,[p/1]).

main :-
     p(X),
     write(X), 
     nl.
@end smallexample  


@noindent
where the file @code{aux.pl} contains: 


@smallexample 
:- module(aux,[p/1]).

p('Hello world').
@end smallexample  


@noindent
This can again be compiled using the 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} standalone compiler as before: 


@smallexample 
/herme@@clip:/tmp
[60]> ciaoc hello

/herme@@clip:/tmp
[61]> hello
Hello world

@end smallexample  


@noindent
The invocation of @code{ciaoc hello} compiles the file @code{hello.pl} and all connected files that may need recompilation -- in this case the file @code{aux.pl}. Also, if any library files used had not been compiled previously they would be compiled at this point (See @ref{Intermediate files in the compilation process}). Also, if, say, @code{hello.pl} is changed and recompiled, the object code resulting from the previous compilation of @code{aux.pl} will be reused. This is all done without any need for @code{Makefile}s, and considerably accelerates the development process for large applications. This process can be observed by selecting the @code{-v} option when invoking @code{ciaoc} (which is equivalent to setting the @code{verbose_compilation} Prolog flag to @code{on} in the top-level interpreter). 

If 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} is defined instead of 
@glindex main/0
@code{main/0} then when the executable is started the argument of 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} will be instantiated to a list of atoms, each one of them corresponding to a command line option. Consider the file @code{say.pl}: 


@smallexample 
main(Argv) :-
     write_list(Argv), nl.

write_list([]).
write_list([Arg|Args]) :- 
     write(Arg),
     write(' '),
     write_list(Args).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
Compiling this program and running it results in the following output: 


@smallexample 
/herme@@clip:/tmp
[91]> ciaoc say

/herme@@clip:/tmp
[91]> say hello dolly
hello dolly 
@end smallexample  

The name of the generated executable can be controlled with the @code{-o} option (See @ref{Usage (ciaoc)}).

@section Paths used by the compiler during compilation 

The compiler will look for files mentioned in commands such as 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1} or 
@glindex ensure_loaded/1
@code{ensure_loaded/1} in the current directory. Other paths can be added by including them in a file whose name is given to @code{ciaoc} using the @code{-u} option. This file should contain facts of the predicates 
@glindex file_search_path/2
@code{file_search_path/2} and 
@glindex library_directory/1
@code{library_directory/1} (see the documentation for these predicates and also @ref{Customizing library paths and path aliases} for details). 



@node Running executables from the command line, Types of executables generated, Paths used by the compiler during compilation, The stand-alone command-line compiler
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Running executables from the command line 
@coindex executables, how to run
@glindex executables, how to run 

As mentioned before, what the @code{ciaoc} compiler generates and how it is started varies somewhat from OS to OS. In general, the product of compiling an application with @code{ciaoc} is a file that contains the bytecode (the product of the compilation) and invokes the 
@glindex Ciao engine
Ciao engine on it. 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Un Un*x this is a @emph{script} (see the first lines of the file) which invokes the ciao engine on this file. To run the generated executable from a Un*x shell, or from the 
@glindex bash
@code{bash} shell that comes with the Cygwin libraries (see @ref{Installation and compilation under Windows}) it suffices to type its name at the shell command line, as in the examples above. 


@item In a Win32 system, the compiler produces a similar file with a @code{.cpx} ending. The Ciao installation process typically makes sure that the Windows registry contains the right entries so that this executable will run upon double-cliking on it. 

In you want to run the executable from the command line an additional @code{.bat} file is typically needed. To help in doing this, the Win32 installation process creates a @code{.bat} skeleton file called @code{bat_skel} in the 
@glindex Win32
@code{Win32} folder of the distribution) which allows running Ciao executables from the command line. If you want to run a Ciao executable @code{file.cpx} from the command line, you normally copy the skeleton file to the folder were the executable is and rename it to @code{file.bat}, then change its contents as explained in a comment inside the file itself. 

Note that this @code{.bat} file is usually not necessary in NT, as its command shell understands file extension associations. I.e., in windows NT it is possible to run the @code{file.cpx} executable directly. Due to limitations of @code{.bat} files in Windows 95/98, in those OSs no more than 9 command line arguments can be passed to the executable (in NT there is no such restriction). 

Finally, in a system in which Cygnus Win32 is installed executables can also be used directly from the 
@glindex bash
@code{bash} shell command line, without any associated @code{.bat} files, by simply typing their name at the 
@glindex bash
@code{bash} shell command line, in the same way as in Un*x. This only requires that the 
@glindex bash
@code{bash} shell which comes with Cygnus Win32 be installed and accessible: simply, make sure that 
@glindex /bin/sh.exe
@code{/bin/sh.exe} exists. 


@end itemize  

Except for a couple of header lines, the contents of executables are almost identical under different OSs (except for self-contained ones). The bytecode they contain is architecture-independent. In fact, it is possible to create an executable under Un*x and run it on Windows or viceversa, by making only minor modifications (e.g., creating the @code{.bat} file and/or setting environment variables or editing the start of the file to point to the correct engine location). 



@node Types of executables generated, Environment variables used by Ciao executables, Running executables from the command line, The stand-alone command-line compiler
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Types of executables generated 


@coindex executables, types
@glindex executables, types 

While the default options used by 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} are sufficient for normal use, by selecting other options 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} can generate several different types of executables, which offer interesting tradeoffs among size of the generated executable, portability, and startup time [CH00b]: 


@table @asis 


@item Dynamic executables: 
@coindex executables, dynamic
@glindex executables, dynamic 


@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} produces by default @emph{dynamic} executables. In this case the executable produced is a 
@glindex platform-independent
platform-independent file which includes in compiled form all the user defined files. On the other hand, any system libraries used by the application are loaded dynamically at startup. More precisely, any files that appear as @code{library(...)} in 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1} and 
@glindex ensure_loaded/1
@code{ensure_loaded/1} declarations will not be included explicitly in the executable and will instead be loaded dynamically. Is is also possible to mark other 
@glindex path aliases
path aliases (see the documentation for 
@glindex file_search_path/2
@code{file_search_path/2}) for dynamic loading by using the @code{-d} option. Files accessed through such aliases will also be loaded dynamically. 

Dynamic loading allows making smaller executables. Such executables may be used directly in the same machine in which they were compiled, since suitable paths to the location of the libraries will be included as default in the executable by 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} during compilation. 

The executable can also be used in another machine, even if the architecture and OS are different. The requirement is that the Ciao libraries (which will also include the appropriate 
@glindex Ciao engine
Ciao engine for that architecture and OS) be installed in the target machine, and that the @code{CIAOLIB} and @code{CIAOENGINE} environment variables are set appropriately for the executable to be able to find them (see @ref{Environment variables used by Ciao executables}). How to do this differs slightly from OS to OS. 


@item Static executables: 
@coindex executables, static
@glindex executables, static 

Selecting the @code{-s} option @code{ciaoc} produces a @emph{static} executable. In this case the executable produced (again a 
@glindex platform-independent
platform-independent file) will include in it all the auxiliary files and any system libraries needed by the application. Thus, such an executable is almost complete, needing in order to run only the 
@glindex Ciao engine
Ciao engine, which is platform-specific.@footnote{Currently there is an exception to this related to libraries which are written in languages other than Prolog, as, e.g., C. C files are currently always compiled to dynamically loadable object files (@code{.so} files), and they thus need to be included manually in a distribution of an application. This will be automated in upcoming versions of the Ciao system.} Again, if the executable is run in the same machine in which it was compiled then the engine is found automatically. If the executable is moved to another machine, the executable only needs access to a suitable engine (which can be done by setting the @code{CIAOENGINE} environment variable to point to this engine). 

This type of compilation produces larger executables, but has the advantage that these executables can be installed and run in a different machine, with different architecture and OS, even if Ciao is not installed on that machine. To install (or distribute) such an executable, one only needs to copy the executable file itself and the appropriate engine for the target platform (See @ref{Installing Ciao from the source distribution} or @ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution} and @ref{Multiarchitecture support}), and to set things so that the executable can find the engine. @footnote{It is also possible to produce real standalone executables, i.e., executables that do not need to have an engine around. However, this is not automated yet, although it is planned for an upcoming version of the compiler. In particular, the compiler can generate a @code{.c} file for each @code{.pl} file. Then all the @code{.c} files can be compiled together into a real executable (the engine is added one more element during link time) producing a complete executable for a given architecture. The downside of course is that such an executable will not be portable to other architectures without recompilation.} 


@item Dynamic executables, with lazy loading: 
@coindex executables, lazy load
@glindex executables, lazy load 

Selecting the @code{-l} option is very similar to the case of dynamic executables above, except that the code in the library modules is not loaded when the program is started but rather it is done during execution, the first time a predicate defined in that file is called. This is advantageous if a large application is composed of many parts but is such that typically only some of the parts are used in each invocation. The Ciao preprocessor, 
@glindex ciaopp
@code{ciaopp}, is a good example of this: it has many capabilitites but typically only some of them are used in a given session. An executable with lazy load has the advantage that it starts fast, loading a minimal functionality on startup, and then loads the different modules automatically as needed. Please beware that initialization directives appearing in a module which is lazily loaded currently are not executed until the module is effectively loaded. Since this happens when the module is first required at runtime, the compiler cannot guarantee the exact time and order in which these directives are executed. 


@item Self-contained executables: 
@coindex executables, self-contained
@glindex executables, self-contained 

@emph{Self-contained} executables are static executables (i.e., this option also implies @emph{static} compilation) which include a Ciao engine along with the bytecode, so they do not depend on an external one for their execution. This is useful to create executables which run even if the machine where the program is to be executed does not have a Ciao engine installed and/or libraries. The disadvantage is that such execuatbles are 
@glindex platform-dependent
platform-dependent (as well as larger than those that simply use an external library). This type of compilation is selected with the @code{-S} option. Cross-compilation is also possible with the @code{-SS} option, so you can specify the target OS and architecture (e.g. LINUXi86). To be able to use the latter option, it is necessary to have installed a ciaoengine for the target machine in the Ciao library (this requires compiling the engine in that OS/architecture and installing it, so that it is available in the library). 


@item Compressed executables: 
@coindex executables, compressed
@glindex executables, compressed 

In @emph{compressed} executables the bytecode is compressed. This allows producing smaller executables, at the cost of a slightly slower startup time. This is selected with the @code{-z} option. You can also produce compressed libraries if you use @code{-zl} along with the @code{-c} option. If you select @code{-zl} while generating an executable, any library which is compiled to accomplish this will be also compressed. 


@item Active modules: 
@coindex modules, active
@glindex modules, active 

The compiler can also compile (via the @code{-a} option) a given file into an 
@coindex active module
@glindex active module
@emph{active module} (see @ref{Active modules (high-level distributed execution)} for a description of this).

@node Environment variables used by Ciao executables, Intermediate files in the compilation process, Types of executables generated, The stand-alone command-line compiler
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Environment variables used by Ciao executables 

The executables generated by the Ciao compiler (including the ciao development tools themselves) locate automatically where the Ciao engine and libraries have been installed, since those paths are stored as defaults in the engine and compiler at installation time. Thus, there is no need for setting any environment variables in order to @emph{run} Ciao executables (on a single architecture -- see @ref{Multiarchitecture support} for running on multiple architectures). 

However, the default paths can be overridden by using the environment variables @code{CIAOENGINE} and @code{CIAOLIB}. The first one will tell the Ciao executables where to look for an engine, and the second will tell them where to look for the libraries. Thus, it is possible to actually use the Ciao system without installing it by setting these variables to the following values: 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{CIAOENGINE}: @code{$(SRC)/bin/$(CIAOARCH)/ciaoengine} 


@item @code{CIAOLIB}: @code{$(SRC)} 


@end itemize  
@noindent
where @code{$(CIAOARCH)} is the string echoed by the command @code{SRC/etc/ciao_get_arch} (or @code{BINROOT/ciao_get_arch}, after installation).

@section Intermediate files in the compilation process 

Compiling an individual source (i.e., @code{.pl}) file produces a @code{.itf} file and a @code{.po} file. The @code{.itf} file contains information of the

@glindex modular interface
@emph{modular interface} of the file, such as information on exported and imported predicates and on the other modules used by this module. This information is used to know if a given file should be recompiled at a given point in time and also to be able to detect more errors statically including undefined predicates, mismatches on predicate charaterictics across modules, etc. The @code{.po} file contains the platform-independent object code for a file, ready for linking (statically or dynamically). 

It is also possible to use @code{ciaoc} to explicitly generate the @code{.po} file for one or more @code{.pl} files by using the @code{-c} option.

ciaoc <MiscOpts> <ExecOpts> [-o <execname>] <file> ...

  Make an executable from the listed files.  If there is
  more than one file, they must be non-module, and the
  first one must include the main predicate.  The -o
  option allows generating an arbitrary executable name.

ciaoc <MiscOpts> <ExecOpts> -a <publishmod> <module>

  Make an active module executable from <module> with
  address publish module <publishmod>.

ciaoc <MiscOpts> -c  <file> ...

  Compile listed files (make .po objects).

<MiscOpts> can be: [-v] [-ri] [-u <file>]

-v  verbose mode

-ri generate human readable .itf files

-u  use <file> for compilation

<ExecOpts> can be: [-s|-S|-SS <target>|-z|-zl|-e|-l|(-ll <module>)*]
                   (-d <alias>)* [-x]

-s  make a static executable (otherwise dynamic files are not included)

-S  make standalone executable for the current OS and architecture

-SS make standalone executable for <target> OS and architecture
    valid <target> values may be: LINUXi86, SolarisSparc...

    (both -S and -SS imply -s)

-z  generate executables with compressed bytecode

-zl generate libraries with compressed bytecode - any library (re)compiled
    as consequence of normal executable compilation will also be affected

-e  make executable with eager load of dynamic files at startup (default)

-l  idem with lazy load of dynamic files (except insecure cases)

-ll force <module> to be loaded lazily,  implies -l

-d  files using this path alias are dynamic (default: library)

-x  Extended recompilation: only useful for Ciao standard library developers

default extension for files is '.pl'

@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh} is the Ciao interactive top-level shell. It provides the user with an interactive programming environment with tools for incrementally building programs, debugging programs by following their executions, and modifying parts of programs without having to start again from scratch. If available, it is strongly recommended to use it with the 
@glindex emacs interface
emacs interface provided, as it greatly simplifies the operation. This chapter documents general operation in the shell itself. Other chapters document the

@section Shell invocation and startup 

When invoked, the shell responds with a message of identification and the prompt @code{?- } as soon as it is ready to accept input, thus: 


@smallexample 
Ciao-Prolog X.Y #PP: Thu Mar 25 17:20:55 MET 1999
?- 
@end smallexample  

When the shell is initialized it looks for a file 
@glindex .ciaorc
@code{.ciaorc} in the HOME directory and makes an @code{include} of it, if it exists. This file is useful for including 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1} declarations for the modules one wants to be loaded by default, changing 
@glindex prolog flag
prolog flags, etc. (Note that the 
@glindex .ciaorc
@code{.ciaorc} file can only contain directives, not actual code; to load some code at startup put it in a separate file and load it using e.g. a 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1} declaration.) If the initialization file does not exist, the default package 
@glindex default
@code{default} is included, to provide more or less what other prologs define by default. Thus, if you want to have available all builtins you had before adding the initialization file, you have to include @code{:- use_package(default)} in it. Two command-line options control the loading of the initialization file: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{-f} 
Fast start, do not load any initialization file. 


@item @code{-l} @code{File} 
Look for initialization file @code{File} instead of @code{~/.ciaorc}. If it does not exist, include the default package. 


@end table  



@node Shell interaction, Entering recursive (conjunctive) shell levels, Shell invocation and startup, The interactive top-level shell
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Shell interaction 

After the shell outputs the prompt, it is expecting either an internal command (see the following sections) or a 
@coindex query
@glindex query
@emph{query} (a goal or sequence of goals). When typing in the input, which must be a valid prolog term, if the term does not end in the first line, subsequent lines are indented. For example: 


@smallexample 
?- X =
   f(a,
   b).

X = f(a,b) ? 

yes
?- 
@end smallexample  

The queries are executed by the shell as if they appeared in the 
@glindex user module
user module. Thus, in addition to builtin predicates, predicates available to be executed directly are all predicates defined by loaded user files (files with no module declaration), and imported predicates from modules by the use of @code{use_module}. 

The possible answers of the shell, after executing an internal command or query, are: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If the execution failed (or produced an error), the answer is @code{no}. 


@item If the execution was successful, and no 
@glindex answer variable
answer variable (see below) was bound (or constraints where imposed on such variables), the answer is simply @code{yes}. This behavior can be changed by doing @code{set_prolog_flag(prompt_alternatives_no_bindings, on).}, so that in any case the user will be consulted as explained in the next point (useful if the solutions produce side effects). 


@item If the execution was successful and bindings where made (or constraints where imposed) on 
@glindex answer variable
answer variables, then the shell outputs the values of answer variables, as a sequence of bindings (or constraints), and then prints a @code{?} as a prompt. At this point it is expecting an input line from the user. By entering a carriage-return (@key{RET}) or any line starting with @code{y}, the query terminates and the shell answer @code{yes}. Entering a `@code{,}' the shell enters a 
@glindex recursive level
recursive level (see below). Finally, any other answer forces the system to backtrack and look for the next solution (answering as with the first solution). 


@end itemize  

To allow using connection variables in queries without having to report their results, variables whose name starts with @code{_} are not considered in answers, the rest being the 
@coindex answer variable
@glindex answer variable
@emph{answer variable}s. This example illustrates the previous points: 


@smallexample 
?- member(a, [b, c]).

no
?- member(a, [a, b]).

yes
?- member(X, [a|L]).

X = a ? ;

L = [X|_] ? 

yes
?- atom_codes(ciao, _C), member(L, _C).

L = 99 ? ;

L = 105 ? ;

L = 97 ? ;

L = 111 ? ;

no
?- 
@end smallexample

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Entering recursive (conjunctive) shell levels 

As stated before, when the user answers with `@code{,}' after a solution is presented, the shell enters a 
@coindex recursive level
@glindex recursive level
@emph{recursive level}, changing its prompt to @emph{N} @code{?- } (where @emph{N} is the recursion level) and keeping the bindings or constraints of the solution (this is inspired by the 
@coindex LogIn
@glindex LogIn
@emph{LogIn} language developed by 
@coindex H. Ait-Kaci
@glindex H. Ait-Kaci
@emph{H. Ait-Kaci}, 
@coindex P. Lincoln
@glindex P. Lincoln
@emph{P. Lincoln} and 
@coindex Roger Nasr
@glindex Roger Nasr
@emph{Roger Nasr} [AKNL86]). Thus, the following queries will be executed within that context, and all variables in the lower level solutions will be reported in subsequent solutions at this level. To exit a recursive level, input an @key{EOF} character or the command @code{up}. The last solution after entering the level is repeated, to allow asking for more solutions. Use command @code{top} to exit all recursive levels and return to the top level. Example interaction: 


@smallexample 
?- directory_files('.',_Fs), member(F,_Fs).

F = 'file_utils.po' ? ,

1 ?- file_property(F, mod_time(T)).

F = 'file_utils.po',
T = 923497679 ? 

yes
1 ?- up.

F = 'file_utils.po' ? ;

F = 'file_utils.pl' ? ;

F = 'file_utils.itf' ? ,

1 ?- file_property(F, mod_time(T)).

F = 'file_utils.itf',
T = 923497679 ? 

yes
1 ?- ^D
F = 'file_utils.itf' ?

The Ciao program development environment includes a number of advanced 
@glindex debugging tools
debugging tools, such as a 
@glindex source-level debugger
source-level debugger, the 
@glindex ciaopp
@code{ciaopp} preprocessor, and some 
@glindex execution visualizers
execution visualizers. Herein we discuss the interactive debugger available in the standard 
@glindex top-level
top-level, which allows tracing the control flow of programs, in a similar way to other popular Prolog systems. This is a classical Byrd @emph{box-type} 
@coindex debugger
@glindex debugger
@emph{debugger} 
@coindex box-type debugger
@glindex box-type debugger 
[Byr80,BBP81], with some enhancements, most notably being able to track the execution on the source program. We also discuss the 
@glindex embedded debugger
embedded debugger, which is a version of the debugger which can be embedded into executables so that an interactive debugging session can be triggered at any time while running that executable without needing the top-level shell. 

Byrd's 
@glindex Procedure Box
Procedure Box model of debugging execution provides a simple way of visualising control flow, including backtracking. Control flow is in principle viewed at the predicate level, rather than at the level of individual clauses. The Ciao debugger has the ability to mark selected modules and/or files for debugging (traditional and source debugging), rather than having to exhaustively trace your program. It also allows to selectively set 
@glindex spy-points
spy-points and 
@glindex breakpoints
breakpoints. Spy-points allow the programmer to nominate interesting predicates at which program execution is to pause so that the programmer can interact with the debugger. Breakpoints are similar to spy-points, but allow pausing at a specific line in the code, corresponding to a particular literal. There is a wide choice of control and information options available during debugging interaction. 

@strong{Note:} While the debugger described herein can be used in a standalone way (i.e., from a operating system shell or terminal window) in the same way as other Prolog debuggers, the most convenient way of debugging Ciao programs is by using the emacs mode (see @ref{Using Ciao inside GNU emacs}), i.e., debugging from within the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor / programming environment.

@section Marking modules and files for debugging in the top-level debugger 

Usually, when a program is not working properly, the programmer has a feeling of which are the modules where the fault may be. Since full-fledged debugging is only available on @emph{interpreted} (called 
@coindex interpreted mode
@glindex interpreted mode
@emph{interpreted mode} in traditional Prolog systems) modules, which are executed much slower than compiled modules, there is the posibility of telling the top level which particular modules are to be loaded in 
@coindex interpreted mode
@glindex interpreted mode
@emph{interpreted mode}, with the aim of debugging them. The simplest way of achieving this is by executing in the Ciao shell prompt, for each suspicious module @code{Module} in the program, a command like this: 


@smallexample 
?- debug_module(Module).
@end smallexample  

An alternative way of loading a module in interpreted mode exists which will instruct the debugger to keep track of the line numbers in the source file and to report them during debugging. This feature can be selected for a suspicious module @code{Module} in the program by executing a command such as: 


@smallexample 
?- debug_module_source(Module).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
This is most useful when running the top-level inside the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor since in that case the Ciao 
@glindex emacs mode
emacs mode allows performing full 
@glindex source-level debugging
source-level debugging in each module marked as above, i.e., the source lines being executed will be highlighted dynamically during debugging in a window showing the source code of the module. 


@coindex user modules, debugging
@glindex user modules, debugging 
Note that all files with no module declaration belong to the pseudo-module @code{user}, so the command to be issued for debugging a user file, say @code{foo.pl}, would be @code{debug_module(user)} or @code{debug_module_source(user)}, and not @code{debug_module(foo)}. 

The two ways of performing 
@glindex source-level debugging
source-level debugging are fully compatible between them, i.e., Ciao allows having some modules loaded with 
@glindex debug_module/1
@code{debug_module/1} and others with 
@glindex debug_module_source/1
@code{debug_module_source/1}. To change from one interpreted mode to the other mode it suffices to select the module with the new interpreted mode (debugger mode), using the appropiate command, and reload the module. 

The commands above perform in fact two related actions: first, they let the compiler know that if a file containing a module with this name is loaded, it should be loaded in interpreted mode (source or traditional). In addition, they instruct the debugger to actually prepare for debugging the code belonging to that module. After that, the modules which are to be debugged have to be (re)loaded so that they are compiled or loaded for interpretation in the appropriate way. The nice thing is that, due to the modular behaviour of the compiler/top-level, if the modules are part of a bigger application, it suffices to load the main module of the application, since this will automatically force the dependent modules which have changed to be loaded in the appropriate way, including those whose 
@coindex loading mode
@glindex loading mode
@emph{loading mode} has changed (i.e., changing the loading mode has the effect of forcing the required re-loading of the module at the appropriate time). 

Later in the debugging process, as the bug location is isolated, typically one will want to restrict more and more the modules where debugging takes place. To this end, and without the need for reloading, one can tell the debugger to not consider a module for debugging issuing a 
@glindex nodebug_module/1
@code{nodebug_module/1} command, which counteracts a 
@glindex debug_module/1
@code{debug_module/1} or 
@glindex debug_module_source/1
@code{debug_module_source/1} command with the same module name, and reloading it (or the main file). 

There are also two top-level commands 
@glindex set_debug_mode/1
@code{set_debug_mode/1} and 
@glindex set_nodebug_mode/1
@code{set_nodebug_mode/1}, which accept as argument a file spec (i.e., @code{library(foo)} or @code{foo}, even if it is a user file) to be able to load a file in interpreted mode without changing the set of modules that the debugger will try to spy.

@section The debugging process 

Once modules or user files are marked for debugging and reloaded, the traditional debugging shell commands can be used (the documentation of the 
@glindex debugger
@code{debugger} library following this chapter contains all the commands and their description), with the same meaning as in other classical Prolog systems. The differences in their behavior are: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Debugging takes place only in the modules in which it was activated, 


@item 
@glindex nospy/1
@code{nospy/1} and 
@glindex spy/1
@code{spy/1} accept sequences of predicate specs, and they will search for those predicates only in the modules marked for debugging (traditional or source-level debugging). 


@item 
@glindex breakpt/6
@code{breakpt/6} and 
@glindex nobreakpt/6
@code{nobreakpt/6} allow setting breakpoints at selected clause literals and will search for those literals only in the modules marked for 
@glindex source-level debugging
source-level debugging (modules marked with 
@glindex debug_module_source/1
@code{debug_module_source/1}). 


@end itemize  

In particular, the system is initially in 
@glindex nodebug
nodebug mode, in which no tracing is performed. The system can be put in 
@glindex debug
debug mode by a call to 
@glindex debug/0
@code{debug/0} in which execution of queries will proceed until the first @emph{spy-point} or @emph{breakpoint}. Alternatively, the system can be put in 
@glindex trace
trace mode by a call to 
@glindex trace/0
@code{trace/0} in which all predicates will be trace. 



@node Marking modules and files for debugging with the embedded debugger, The procedure box control flow model, The debugging process, The interactive debugger
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Marking modules and files for debugging with the embedded debugger 

The embedded debugger, as the interpreted debugger, has three different modes of operation: debug, trace or nodebug. These debuggers modes can be set by adding a package declaration in the module, as follows: 


@smallexample 
:- use_package(debug).
:- use_package(trace).
:- use_package(nodebug).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
and recompiling the application. 

In order to debug, or trace, correctly the complete code these declarations @emph{must} appear the last ones of all 
@glindex use_package
@code{use_package} declarations used. Also it is possible, as usual, to add the debugging package(s) in the module declaration using the predicate 
@glindex module/3
@code{module/3} (and they should also be the last ones). 

The embedded debugger has limitations over the interpreted debugger. The most important is that the ``retry'' option is not available. But it is possible to add, and remove, 
@glindex spy-points
spy-points and 
@glindex breakpoins
breakpoins using the predicates 
@glindex spy/1
@code{spy/1}, 
@glindex nospy/1
@code{nospy/1}, 
@glindex breakpt/6
@code{breakpt/6} and 
@glindex nobreakpt/6
@code{nobreakpt/6}, etc. These can be used in a clause declaration or as declarations. Also it is possible to add in the code predicates for issuing the debugger (i.e., use debug mode, and in a clause add the predicate 
@glindex trace/1
@code{trace/1}). 

The nodebug mode allows keeping the spy-points and breakpoints in the code instead of removing them from the code. 

Note that there is a particularly interesting way of using the 
@glindex embedded debugger
embedded debugger: if an @emph{application} is run in a shell buffer which has been set with Ciao inferior mode (@key{M-x} @code{ciao-inferior-mode}) and this application starts emitting output from the embedded debugger (i.e., which contains the embedded debugger and is debugging its code) then the Ciao emacs mode will be able to follow these messages, for example tracking execution in the source level code. This also works if the application is written in a combination of languages, provided the parts written in Ciao are compiled with the embedded debugger package and is thus a covenient way of debugging multi-language applications. The only thing needed is to make sure that the output messages appear in a shell buffer that is in Ciao inferior mode. 

See the following as a general example of use of the embedded debugger: 
@smallexample 
:- module( foo,[main/1],[assertions, debug]).

:- entry main/1.

main(X) :- 
         display(X),
         spy(foo), 
         foo(X), 
         notrace,
         nl.

foo([]).  
foo([X|T]) :-  
        trace,
        bar(X), 
        foo(T).

bar(X) :- 
        display(X).
@end smallexample

@section The procedure box control flow model 

During debugging the interpreter prints out a sequence of goals in various states of instantiation in order to show the state that the program has reached in its execution. However, in order to understand what is occurring it is necessary to understand when and why the interpreter prints out goals. As in other programming languages, key points of interest are procedure entry and return, but in Prolog there is the additional complexity of backtracking. One of the major confusions that novice Prolog programmers have to face is the question of what actually happens when a goal fails and the system suddenly starts backtracking. The Procedure Box model of Prolog execution views program control flow in terms of movement about the program text. This model provides a basis for the debugging mechanism in the interpreter, and enables the user to view the behaviour of the program in a consistent way. It also provides the basis for the visualization performed on the source level program when source level program when 
@glindex source-level debugging
source-level debugging is activated within 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}. 
 
Let us look at an example Prolog procedure: 

@image{autofigbyrdbox} 

The first clause states that @code{Y} is a descendant of @code{X} if @code{Y} is an offspring of @code{X}, and the second clause states that @code{Y} is a descendant of @code{X} if @code{Z} is an offspring of @code{X} and @code{Y} is a descendant of @code{Z}. In the diagram a box has been drawn around the whole procedure and labelled arrows indicate the control flow in and out of this box. There are four such arrows which we shall look at in turn. 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @strong{Call} 

This arrow represents initial invocation of the procedure. When a goal of the form @code{descendant(X,Y)} is required to be satisfied, control passes through the Call port of the descendant box with the intention of matching a component clause and then satisfying any subgoals in the body of that clause. Note that this is independent of whether such a match is possible; i.e. first the box is called, and then the attempt to match takes place. Textually we can imagine moving to the code for descendant when meeting a call to descendant in some other part of the code. 


@item @strong{Exit} 

This arrow represents a successful return from the procedure. This occurs when the initial goal has been unified with one of the component clauses and any subgoals have been satisfied. Control now passes out of the Exit port of the descendant box. Textually we stop following the code for descendant and go back to the place we came from. 


@item @strong{Redo} 

This arrow indicates that a subsequent goal has failed and that the system is backtracking in an attempt to find alternatives to previous solutions. Control passes through the Redo port of the descendant box. An attempt will now be made to resatisfy one of the component subgoals in the body of the clause that last succeeded; or, if that fails, to completely rematch the original goal with an alternative clause and then try to satisfy any subgoals in the body of this new clause. Textually we follow the code backwards up the way we came looking for new ways of succeeding, possibly dropping down on to another clause and following that if necessary. 


@item @strong{Fail} 

This arrow represents a failure of the initial goal, which might occur if no clause is matched, or if subgoals are never satisfied, or if any solution produced is always rejected by later processing. Control now passes out of the Fail port of the descendant box and the system continues to backtrack. Textually we move back to the code which called this procedure and keep moving backwards up the code looking for choice points. 
@end itemize  

In terms of this model, the information we get about the procedure box is only the control flow through these four ports. This means that at this level we are not concerned with which clause matches, and how any subgoals are satisfied, but rather we only wish to know the initial goal and the final outcome. However, it can be seen that whenever we are trying to satisfy subgoals, what we are actually doing is passing through the ports of @emph{their} respective boxes. If we were following this (e.g., activating 
@glindex source-level debugging
source-level debugging), then we would have complete information about the control flow inside the procedure box. 

Note that the box we have drawn around the procedure should really be seen as an invocation box. That is, there will be a different box for each different invocation of the procedure. Obviously, with something like a recursive procedure, there will be many different Calls and Exits in the control flow, but these will be for different invocations. Since this might get confusing each invocation box is given a unique integer identifier in the messages, as described below. 

Note that not all procedure calls are traced; there are a few basic predicates which have been made invisible since it is more convenient not to trace them. These include debugging directives, basic control structures, and some builtins. This means that messages will never be printed for these predicates during debugging. 



@node Format of debugging messages, Options available during debugging, The procedure box control flow model, The interactive debugger
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Format of debugging messages 

This section explains the two formats of the message output by the debugger at a port. All trace messages are output to the terminal regardless of where the current output stream is directed (which allows tracing programs while they are performing file I/O). The basic format, which will be shown in traditional debug and in source-level debugging within Ciao 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} mode, is as follows: 


@smallexample 
S  13  7  Call: T user:descendant(dani,_123) ?
@end smallexample  

@code{S} is a spy-point or breakpoint indicator. It is printed as '@code{+}', indicating that there is a spy-point on @code{descendant/2} in module @code{user}, as @code{'B'} denoting a breakpoint, or as ' ', denoting no spy-point or breakpoint. If there is a spy-point and a breakpoint in the same predicate the spy-point indicator takes preference over breakpoint indicator. 

@code{T} is a subterm trace. This is used in conjunction with the @code{^} command (set subterm), described below. If a subterm has been selected, @code{T} is printed as the sequence of commands used to select the subterm. Normally, however, @code{T} is printed as ' ', indicating that no subterm has been selected. 

The first number is the unique invocation identifier. It is always nondecreasing (provided that the debugger is switched on) regardless of whether or not the invocations are being actually seen. This number can be used to cross correlate the trace messages for the various ports, since it is unique for every invocation. It will also give an indication of the number of procedure calls made since the start of the execution. The invocation counter starts again for every fresh execution of a command, and it is also reset when retries (see later) are performed. 

The number following this is the @emph{current depth}; i.e., the number of direct @emph{ancestors} this goal has. The next word specifies the particular port (@code{Call}, @code{Exit}, @code{Redo} or @code{Fail}). The goal is then printed so that its current instantiation state can be inspected. The final @code{?} is the prompt indicating that the debugger is waiting for user interaction. One of the option codes allowed (see below) can be input at this point. 

The second format, quite similar to the format explained above, is shown when using source-level debugging outside the Ciao 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} mode, and it is as follows: 


@smallexample 
	   In /home/mcarlos/ciao/foo.pl (5-9) descendant-1
S  13  7  Call: T user:descendant(dani,_123) ?
@end smallexample  

This format is identical to the format above except for the first line, which contains the information for location of the point in the source program text where execution is currently at. The first line contains the name of the source file, the start and end lines where the literal can be found, the substring to search for between those lines and the number of substrings to locate. This information for locating the point on the source file is not shown when executing the source-level debugger from the Ciao 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} mode. 

Ports can be ``unleashed'' by calling the 
@glindex leash/1
@code{leash/1} predicate omiting that port in the argument. This means that the debugger will stop but user interaction is not possible for an unleashed port. Obviously, the @code{?} prompt will not be shown in such messages, since the user has specified that no interaction is desired at this point.

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Options available during debugging 
@coindex debug options
@glindex debug options 

This section describes the particular options that are available when the debugger prompts after printing out a debugging message. All the options are one letter mnemonics, some of which can be optionally followed by a decimal integer. They are read from the terminal with any blanks being completely ignored up to the next terminator (carriage-return, line-feed, or escape). Some options only actually require the terminator; e.g., the creep option, only requires @key{RET}. 

The only option which really needs to be remembered is '@code{h}' (followed by @key{RET}). This provides help in the form of the following list of available options. 


@smallexample 
<cr>   creep            c      creep
 l     leap             s      skip

 ^     reset subterm    ^ <n>  set subterm
 ?     help             h      help
@end smallexample  


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{c} (
@coindex creep
@glindex creep
@emph{creep}) 

causes the debugger to single-step to the very next port and print a message. Then if the port is leashed the user is prompted for further interaction. Otherwise it continues creeping. If leashing is off, creep is the same as leap (see below) except that a complete trace is printed on the terminal. 


@item @code{l} (
@coindex leap
@glindex leap
@emph{leap}) 

causes the interpreter to resume running the program, only stopping when a spy-point or breakpoint is reached (or when the program terminates). Leaping can thus be used to follow the execution at a higher level than exhaustive tracing. All that is needed to do is to set spy-points and breakpoints on an evenly spread set of pertinent predicates or lines, and then follow the control flow through these by leaping from one to the other. 


@item @code{s} (
@coindex skip
@glindex skip
@emph{skip}) 

is only valid for Call and Redo ports, if it is issued in Exit or Fail ports it is equivalent to creep. It skips over the entire execution of the predicate. That is, no message will be seen until control comes back to this predicate (at either the Exit port or the Fail port). Skip is particularly useful while creeping since it guarantees that control will be returned after the (possibly complex) execution within the box. With skip then no message at all will appear until control returns to the Exit port or Fail port corresponding to this Call port or Redo port. This includes calls to predicates with spy-points and breakpoints set: they will be masked out during the skip. There is a way of overriding this: the @code{t} option after a @key{^C} interrupt will disable the masking. Normally, however, this masking is just what is required! 


@item @code{r} (
@coindex retry
@glindex retry
@emph{retry}) 

can be used at any of the four ports (although at the Call port it has no effect). It transfers control back to the Call port of the box. This allows restarting an invocation when, for example, it has left the programmer with some weird result. The state of execution is exactly the same as in the original call (unless the invocation has performed side effects, which will not be undone). When a retry is performed the invocation counter is reset so that counting will continue from the current invocation number regardless of what happened before the retry. This is in accord with the fact that execution has, in operational terms, returned to the state before anything else was called. 

If an integer is supplied after the retry command, then this is taken as specifying an invocation number and the system tries to get to the Call port, not of the current box, but of the invocation box specified. It does this by continuously failing until it reaches the right place. Unfortunately this process cannot be guaranteed: it may be the case that the invocation the programmer is looking for has been cut out of the search space by cuts in the program. In this case the system fails to the latest surviving Call port before the correct one. 


@item @code{f} (
@coindex fail
@glindex fail
@emph{fail}) 

can be used at any of the four ports (although at the Fail port it has no effect). It transfers control to the Fail port of the box, forcing the invocation to fail prematurely. If an integer is supplied after the command, then this is taken as specifying an invocation number and the system tries to get to the Fail port of the invocation box specified. It does this by continuously failing until it reaches the right place. Unfortunately, as before, this process cannot be guaranteed. 


@item @code{d} (
@coindex display
@glindex display
@emph{display}) 

displays the current goal using @code{display/1}. See @code{w} below. 


@item @code{p} (
@coindex print
@glindex print
@emph{print}) 

re-prints the current goal using @code{print/1}. Nested structures will be printed to the specified @emph{printdepth} (see below). 


@item @code{w} (
@coindex write
@glindex write
@emph{write}) 

writes the current goal on the terminal using @code{write/1}. 


@item @code{g} (
@coindex ancestors
@glindex ancestors
@emph{ancestors}) 

provides a list of ancestors to the current goal, i.e., all goals that are hierarchically above the current goal in the calling sequence. It is always possible to jump to any goal in the ancestor list (by using retry, etc.). If an integer @code{n} is supplied, then only @code{n} ancestors will be printed. That is to say, the last @code{n} ancestors will be printed counting back from the current goal. Each entry in the list is preceded by the invocation number followed by the depth number (as would be given in a trace message). 


@item @code{n} (
@coindex nodebug
@glindex nodebug
@emph{nodebug}) 

switches the debugger off. Note that this is the correct way to switch debugging off at a trace point. The @code{@@} option cannot be used because it always returns to the debugger. 


@item @code{=} (
@coindex debugging
@glindex debugging
@emph{debugging}) 

outputs information concerning the status of the current debugging session. 


@item @code{+} 
@coindex spy
@glindex spy
@emph{spy} 

sets a spy-point on the current goal. 


@item @code{-} (
@coindex nospy
@glindex nospy
@emph{nospy}) 

removes the spy-point from the current goal. 


@item @code{a} (
@coindex abort
@glindex abort
@emph{abort}) 

causes an abort of the current execution. All the execution states built so far are destroyed and the system is put right back at the top-level of the interpreter. (This is the same as the built-in predicate @code{abort/0}.) 


@item @code{@@} (
@coindex command
@glindex command
@emph{command}) 

allows calling arbitrary goals. The initial message @code{| ?- } will be output on the terminal, and a command is then read from the terminal and executed as if it was at top-level. 


@item @code{u} (
@coindex unify
@glindex unify
@emph{unify}() 

is available at the Call port and gives the option of providing a solution to the goal from the terminal rather than executing the goal. This is convenient, e.g., for providing a ``stub'' for a predicate that has not yet been written. A prompt @code{|: } will be output on the terminal, and the solution is then read from the terminal and unified with the goal. 


@item @code{<} (
@coindex printdepth
@glindex printdepth
@emph{printdepth}) 

sets a limit for the subterm nesting level that is printed in messages. While in the debugger, a printdepth is in effect for limiting the subterm nesting level when printing the current goal. When displaying or writing the current goal, all nesting levels are shown. The limit is initially 10. This command, without arguments, resets the limit to 10. With an argument of @code{n} the limit is set to @code{n}. 


@item @code{^} (
@coindex subterm
@glindex subterm
@emph{subterm}) 

sets the subterm to be printed in messages. While at a particular port, a current subterm of the current goal is maintained. It is the current subterm which is displayed, printed, or written when prompting for a debugger command. Used in combination with the printdepth, this provides a means for navigating in the current goal for focusing on the part which is of interest. The current subterm is set to the current goal when arriving at a new port. This command, without arguments, resets the current subterm to the current goal. With an argument of @code{n} (greater than 0 and less or equal to the number of subterms of the current subterm), the current subterm is replaced by its @code{n}'th subterm. With an argument of @code{0}, the current subterm is replaced by its parent term. 


@item @code{?} or @code{h} (
@coindex help
@glindex help
@emph{help}) 

displays the table of options given above.

@section Calling predicates that are not exported by a module 

The Ciao module system does not allow calling predicates which are not exported during debugging. However, as an aid during debugging, this is allowed (only from the top-level and for modules which are in debug mode or source-level debug mode) using the 
@glindex call_in_module/2
@code{call_in_module/2} predicate. 

Note that this does not affect analysis or optimization issues, since it only works on modules which are loaded in debug mode or source-level debug mode, i.e. unoptimized.

Originally written by Andrzej Ciepielewski. Minor modifications by Mats Carlsson. Later modifications (17 Dec 87) by Takashi Chikayama (making tracer to use 
@glindex print/1
@code{print/1} rather than 
@glindex write/1
@code{write/1}, temporarily switching debugging flag off while writing trace message and within ``break'' level). Additional modifications by Kish Shen (May 88): subterm navigation, handle unbound args in 
@glindex spy/1
@code{spy/1} and 
@glindex nospy/1
@code{nospy/1}, trapping arithmetics errors in debug mode. Adapted then to &-Prolog and Ciao by D. Cabeza and included in the Ciao version control system. Extended for source-level debugging by Manuel C. Rodr@'{@dotlessi}guez. (See changelog if included in the document for more detailed documentation of the later changes.)

@glindex ciao-shell
@code{ciao-shell} is the Ciao script interpreter. It can be used to write 
@coindex Prolog shell scripts
@glindex Prolog shell scripts
@emph{Prolog shell scripts} (see [Her96,CHV96b]), that is, executable files containing source code, which are compiled on demand. 

Writing Prolog scripts can sometimes be advantageous with respect to creating binary executables for small- to medium-sized programs that are modified often and perform relatively simple tasks. The advantage is that no explicit compilation is necessary, and thus changes and updates to the program imply only editing the source file. The disadvantage is that startup of the script (the first time after it is modified) is slower than for an application that has been compiled previously. 

An area of application is, for example, writing 
@coindex CGI executables
@glindex CGI executables
@emph{CGI executables}: the slow speed of the network connection in comparison with that of executing a program makes program execution speed less important and has made scripting languages very popular for writing these applications. Logic languages are, a priori, excellent candidates to be used as scripting languages. For example, the built-in grammars and databases can sometimes greatly simplify many typical script-based applications.

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section How it works 

Essentially, @code{ciao-shell} is a smaller version of the Ciao top-level, which starts by loading the file given to it as the first argument and then starts execution at 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} (the argument is instantiated to a list containing the command line options, in the usual way). Note that the Prolog script cannot have a @code{module} declaration for this to work. While loading the file, @code{ciao-shell} changes the 
@glindex prolog flag
prolog flag @code{quiet} so that no informational or warning messages are printed (error messages will be reported to @code{user_error}, however). The operation of @code{ciao-shell} in Unix-like systems is based in a special compiler feature: when the first character of a file is '@code{#}', the compiler skips the first lines until an empty line is found. In Windows, its use is as easy as naming the file with a @code{.pls} extension, which will launch @code{ciao-shell} appropriately. 

For example, in a Linux/Unix system, assume a file called 
@glindex hello
@code{hello} contains the following program: 


@smallexample 
#!/bin/sh 
exec ciao-shell $0 "$@@" # -*- mode: ciao; -*-

main(_) :-
     write('Hello world'), nl.
@end smallexample  

Then, the file 
@glindex hello
@code{hello} can be @emph{run} by simply making it executable and invoking it from the command line: 


@smallexample 
/herme@@clip:/tmp
[86]> chmod +x hello

/herme@@clip:/tmp
[87]> hello
Hello world
@end smallexample  

The line: 
@smallexample 
#!/bin/sh 
@end smallexample  
@noindent
invokes the @code{/bin/sh} shell which will interpret the following line: 
@smallexample 
exec ciao-shell $0 "$@@" # -*- mode: ciao; -*-
@end smallexample  


@noindent
and invoke 
@glindex ciao-shell
@code{ciao-shell}, instructing it to read this same file (@code{$0}), passing it the rest of the arguments to @code{hello} as arguments to the prolog program. The second part of the line @code{# -*- mode: ciao; -*-} is simply a comment which is seen by 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} and instructs it to edit this file in Ciao mode (this is needed because these script files typically do not have a @code{.pl} ending). When 
@glindex ciao-shell
@code{ciao-shell} starts, if it is the first time, it compiles the program (skipping the first lines, as explained above), or else at successive runs loads the @code{.po} object file, and then calls 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1}. 

Note that the process of creating Prolog scripts is made very simple by the Ciao 
@glindex emacs mode
emacs mode, which automatically inserts the header and makes the file executable (See @ref{Using Ciao inside GNU emacs}).

@section Command line arguments in scripts 


@noindent
The following example illustrates the use of command-line arguments in scripts. Assume that a file called @code{say} contains the following lines: 


@smallexample 
#!/bin/sh 
exec ciao-shell $0 "$@@" # -*- mode: ciao; -*-

main(Argv) :-
     write_list(Argv), nl.

write_list([]).
write_list([Arg|Args]) :- 
     write(Arg),
     write(' '),
     write_list(Args).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
An example of use is: 


@smallexample 
/herme@@clip:/tmp
[91]> say hello dolly
hello dolly 
@end smallexample

This library provides means for customizing, from environment variables, the libraries and 
@glindex path alias
path aliases known by an executable. Many applications of Ciao, including 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}, 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}, and 
@glindex ciao-shell
@code{ciao-shell} make use of this library. Note that if an executable is created dynamic, it will try to load its components at startup, before the procedures of this module can be invoked, so in this case all the components should be in standard locations.

@section Conventions for writing Ciao programs under Emacs 
@coindex formatting conventions, for emacs
@glindex formatting conventions, for emacs 

This is particularly important for the 
@glindex source-level debugger
source-level debugger and the 
@glindex syntax-based coloring
syntax-based coloring capabilities. This is due to the fact that it would be unrealistic to write a complete Prolog parser in Emacs lisp. These conventions are the following, in order of importance: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Clauses should begin on the first column (this is used to recognize the beginning of a clause). 


@item C style comments should not be used in a clause, but can be used outside any clause. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
The following suggestion is not strictly necessary but can improve operation: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Body literals should be indented. There should be not more than one literal per line. This allows more precision in the location of program points during source-level debugging, i.e., when marking breakpoints and during line tracing. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
Comments which start with @code{%}s are indented to the right if indentation is asked for. 


@noindent
For syntax-based highlighting to be performed font-lock must be available and not disabled (the Ciao mode enables it but it may be disabled elsewhere in, e.g., the 
@glindex .emacs
@code{.emacs} file). 



@node Checking the installation, Functionality and associated key sequences (bindings), Conventions for writing Ciao programs under Emacs, Using Ciao inside GNU emacs
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Checking the installation 

Typically, a complete pre-installation of the Ciao/Prolog 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} interface is completed during Ciao installation. To check that installation was done and sucessful, open a file with a @code{.pl} ending. You should see that 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} enters Ciao/Prolog mode: the mode is identified in the 
@glindex status bar
status bar below the 
@glindex buffer
buffer and, if the 
@glindex emacs menu bar
emacs menu bar is enabled, you should see the Ciao/Prolog menus. You should be able from the menu-bar, for example, to go to the Ciao manuals in the info or load the @code{.pl} file that you just opened into a ciao top level. 

If things don't work properly, see the section @ref{Installation of the Ciao/Prolog emacs interface} later in this chapter.

@section Syntax coloring and syntax-based editing 

Syntax-based highlighting (coloring) of code is provided automatically when opening Ciao/Prolog files. This includes also the assertions used by the preprocessor and the documentation strings used by the Ciao auto-documenter, 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc}. The mode should be set to Ciao/Prolog and the Ciao mode menus should appear on the menu bar. The colors and fonts used can be changed through the 
@coindex customize
@glindex customize
@emph{customize} options in the help menu (see @ref{Customization}). 

During editing this coloring may be refreshed by calling the appropriate function (see below). 

Limited syntax-based auto-indentation and auto-fill of code and comments is also provided. Syntax highlighting and coloring is also available for the error and warning messages produced by the top level, preprocessor, and auto-documenter, and, in general, for the output produced by these tools. 


@noindent
Commands: 


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{h}

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Getting on-line help 

The following commands are useful for getting on-line help. This is done by accessing the 
@glindex info
@code{info} version of the Ciao manuals or the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} built-in help strings. Note also that the 
@glindex info
@code{info} standard @code{search} command (generally bound to @key{s}) can be used inside 
@glindex info
@code{info} buffers to search for a given string. 


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{TAB}  
Find help for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive, declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor. Opens a (hopefully) relevant part of the Ciao manuals in 
@glindex info
@code{info} mode. Requires that the Ciao manuals in 
@glindex info
@code{info} format be installed and accessible to 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} (i.e., they should appear somewhere in the info directory when typing @code{M-x info}). It also requires 
@glindex word-help.el
@code{word-help.el}, which is provided with Ciao. Refer to the installation instructions if this is not the case. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{/}  
Find a completion for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive, declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor. Uses for completion the contents of the indices of the Ciao manuals. Same requirements as for finding help for the symbol. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^M}  
Go to the part of the info directory containing the Ciao manuals. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^H} @key{m}  
Show a short description of the Ciao/Prolog emacs mode, including all key bindings. 
@end table  



@node Loading and compiling programs, Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers, Getting on-line help, Using Ciao inside GNU emacs
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Loading and compiling programs 

These commands allow 
@coindex loading programs
@glindex loading programs
@emph{loading programs}, 
@coindex creating executables
@glindex creating executables
@emph{creating executables}, etc. by issuing the appropriate commands to a Ciao/Prolog top level shell, running in its own buffer as a subprocess. See @ref{The interactive top-level shell} for details. The following commands implement the communication with the Ciao/Prolog top level: 


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{t}  
Ensure that an inferior Ciao/Prolog top-level process is running. 

This opens a top-level window (if one did not exist already) where queries can be input directly as in any normal Prolog top level. Programs can be loaded into this top level by typing the corresponding commands in this window (such as use_module, etc.), or, more typically, by opening the file to be loaded in an emacs window (where it can be edited) and issuing a load command (such as C-c l or C-c L) directly from there (see the loading commands of this mode and their bindings). 

Note that many useful commands (e.g., to repeat and edit previous commands, interrupt jobs, locate errors, automatic completions, etc.) are available in this top-level window (see @ref{Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers}). 

Often, it is not necessary to use this function since execution of any of the other functions related to the top level (e.g., loading buffers into the top level) ensures that a top level is started (starting one if required). 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{l}  
Load the current buffer (and any auxiliary files it may use) into the top level. 

The type of compilation performed (
@coindex compiling
@glindex compiling
@emph{compiling} or 
@coindex interpreting
@glindex interpreting
@emph{interpreting}) is selected automatically depending on whether the buffer has been marked for debugging or not -- see below. In case you try to load a file while in the middle of the debugging process the debugger is first aborted and then the buffer is loaded. Also, if there is a defined query, the user is asked whether it should be called. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{x}  
Make an executable from the code in the current buffer. The buffer must contain a 
@glindex main/0
@code{main/0} or 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} predicate. Note that compiler options can be set to determine whether the libraries and auxiliary files used by the executable will be statically linked, dynamically linked, auto-loaded, etc. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{o}  
Make a Prolog object (.po) file from the code in the current buffer. This is useful for example while debugging during development of a very large application which is compiled into an excutable, and only one or a few files are modified. If the application executable is dynamically linked, i.e., the component .po files are loaded dynamically during startup of the application, then this command can be used to recompile only the file or files which have changed, and the correct version will be loaded dynamically the next time the application is started. However, note that this must be done with care since it only works if the inter-module interfaces have not changed. The recommended, much safer way is to generate the executable again, letting the Ciao compiler, which is inherently incremental, determine what needs to be recompiled. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{a}  
Make an active module executable from the code in the current buffer. An active module is a remote procedure call server (see the 
@glindex activemod
@code{activemod} library documentation for details). 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{s}  
Set the current buffer as the principal file in a multiple module programming environment. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{L}  
Load the module designated as 
@coindex main module
@glindex main module
@emph{main module} (and all related files that it uses) into the top level. If no main module is defined it will load the current buffer. 

The type of compilation performed (
@coindex compiling
@glindex compiling
@emph{compiling} or 
@coindex interpreting
@glindex interpreting
@emph{interpreting}) is selected automatically depending on whether the buffer has been marked for debugging or not -- see below. In case you try to load a file while in the middle of the debugging process the debugger is first aborted and then the buffer is loaded. Also, if there is a defined query, the user is asked whether is should be called. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{q}  
Set a default query. This may be useful specially during debugging sessions. However, as mentioned elsewhere, note that commands that repeat previous queries are also available. 

This query can be recalled at any time using C-c Q. It is also possible to set things up so that this query will be issued automatically any time a program is (re)loaded. The functionality is available in the major mode (i.e., from a buffer containing a source file) and in the inferior mode (i.e., from the buffer running the top-level shell). When called from the major mode (i.e., from window containing a source file) then the user is prompted in the minibuffer for the query. When called from the inferior mode (i.e., from a top-level window) then the query on the current line, following the Ciao prompt, is taken as the default query. 

To clear the default query use M-x ciao-clear-query or simply set it to an empty query: i.e., in a source buffer select C-c q and enter an empty query. In an inferior mode simply select C-c q on a line that contains only the system prompt. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{Q}  
Issue predefined query. 
@end table

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers 

The interactive top level and the preprocessor both are typically run in an iteractive buffer, in which it is possible to communicate with them in the same way as if they had been started from a standard shell. These interactive buffers run in the so-called @emph{Ciao/Prolog inferior mode}. This is a particular version of the standard emacs shell package (comint) and thus all the commands typically available when running shells inside emacs also work in these buffers. In addition, many of the commands and key bindings available in buffers containing Ciao source code are also available in these interactive buffers, when applicable. The Ciao/Prolog-specific commands available include: 


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{TAB}  
Find help for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive, declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor. Opens a (hopefully) relevant part of the Ciao manuals in 
@glindex info
@code{info} mode. Requires that the Ciao manuals in 
@glindex info
@code{info} format be installed and accessible to 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} (i.e., they should appear somewhere in the info directory when typing @code{M-x info}). It also requires 
@glindex word-help.el
@code{word-help.el}, which is provided with Ciao. Refer to the installation instructions if this is not the case. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{/}  
Find a completion for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive, declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor. Uses for completion the contents of the indices of the Ciao manuals. Same requirements as for finding help for the symbol. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{`}  
Go to the location in the source file containing the next error reported by the last Ciao/Prolog subprocess (preprocessor or toplevel) which was run. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{e}  
Remove error marks from last run (and also debugging marks if present). 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{q}  
Set a default query. This may be useful specially during debugging sessions. However, as mentioned elsewhere, note that commands that repeat previous queries are also available. 

This query can be recalled at any time using C-c Q. It is also possible to set things up so that this query will be issued automatically any time a program is (re)loaded. The functionality is available in the major mode (i.e., from a buffer containing a source file) and in the inferior mode (i.e., from the buffer running the top-level shell).

@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{Q}  
Issue predefined query. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^V}  
Show last output file produced by Ciao preprocessor. The preprocessor works by producing a file which is a transformed and/or adorned (with assertions) version of the input file. This command is often used after running the preprocessor in order to visit the output file and see the results from running the preprocessor. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{v}  
Report the version of the emacs Ciao/Prolog mode. 
@end table  


 
@noindent
The following are some of the commands from the comint shell package which may be specially useful (type @code{M-x describe-mode} while in a Ciao interactive buffer for a complete list of commands): 


@table @asis 


@item @key{M-p}  
Cycle backwards through input history. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{M-n}  
Cycle forwards through input history. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{M-r}

Stop the current subjob. This command also kills the pending input between the process-mark and point. 

WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up suspending the top-level process running in the buffer. If you accidentally do this, use M-x comint-continue-subjob to resume the process. (This is not a problem with most shells, since they ignore this signal.)

@section Debugging programs 

These commands allow marking modules for 
@coindex debugging
@glindex debugging
@emph{debugging} by issuing the appropiate commands to a Ciao/Prolog top level shell, running in its own buffer as a subprocess. There are two differents types of debugging: traditional Prolog debugging (using the 
@glindex byrd-box model
byrd-box model and 
@glindex spy-points
spy-points) and 
@coindex source-level debugging

breakpoints). 
@coindex debugging, source-level
@glindex debugging, source-level 
In order to use 
@coindex breakpoints
@glindex breakpoints
@emph{breakpoints}, source debugging must be on. The following commands implement comunication with the Ciao/Prolog top level: 


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{d}  
Debug (or stop debugging) buffer source. This is a shortcut which is particularly useful when using the source debugger on a single module. It corresponds to several lower-level actions. Those lower-level actions depend on how the module was selected for debugging. In case the module was not marked for source-level debugging, it marks the module corresponding to the current buffer for source-level debugging, reloads it to make sure that it is loaded in the correct way for debugging (same as C-c l), and sets the debugger in trace mode (i.e., issues the @code{trace.} command to the top-level shell). Conversely, if the module was already marked for source-level debugging then it will take the opposite actions, i.e., it unmarks the module for source-level debugging, reloads it, and sets the debugger to non-debug mode. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{m}  
Mark, or unmkark, the current buffer for debugging (traditional debugging or source debugging). Note that if the buffer has already been loaded while it was unmarked for debugging (and has therefore been loaded in ``compile'' mode) it has to be loaded again. The minibuffer shows how the module is loaded now and allows selecting another mode for it. There are three posibilities: N for no debug, S for source debug and D for traditional debug. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{M-m}  
Visits all Ciao/Prolog files which are currently open in a buffer allowing selecting for each of them whether to debug them or not and the type of debugging performed. When working on a multiple module program, it is possible to have many modules open at a time. In this case, you will navigate through all open Ciao/Prolog files and select the debug mode for each of them (same as doing C-c m for each). 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{S} @key{b}  
Set a breakpoint on the current literal (goal). This can be done at any time (while debugging or not). The cursor must be @emph{on the predicate symbol of the literal}. Breakpoints are only useful when using source-level debugging. 
@end table

@item @key{^C} @key{r}  
Load the current region (between the cursor and a previous mark) into the top level. Since loading a region of a file is typically done for debugging and/or testing purposes, this command always loads the region in debugging mode (interpreted). 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{p}

See the preprocessor manual for details. The following commands implement the communication with the Ciao preprocessor: 


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{M}  
Preprocess the buffer, selecting options. Instructs the preprocessor to load the current buffer and start an interactive dialog in which the different options available in the preprocessor can be set. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{P}  
Preprocess the buffer, using the previously selected options. If no options were set previously, then the preprocessor defaults are used. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{T}  
Uses the preprocessor to perform compile-time checking of types and modes (pptypesfd and shfr analyses). 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^P}  
Make ciaopp output only predicate-level analysis information. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^F}  
Make ciaopp output both literal- and predicate-level analysis information. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^X}  
Make ciaopp output no analysis information. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^V}  
Show last output file produced by Ciao preprocessor. The preprocessor works by producing a file which is a transformed and/or adorned (with assertions) version of the input file. This command is often used after running the preprocessor in order to visit the output file and see the results from running the preprocessor. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{V}  
Preprocess the buffer, using the previously selected (or default) options, waits for preprocessing to finish and displays the preprocessor output (leaving the cursor at the same point if already on a preprocessor output file). This allows running the preprocessor over and over and watching the output while modifying the source code. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^R}  
Ensure that an inferior Ciao preprocessor process is running. 

This opens a preprocessor top-level window (if one did not exist already) where preprocessing commands and preprocessing menu options can be input directly. Programs can be preprocessed by typing commands in this window, or, more typically, by opening the file to be preprocessed in an emacs window (where it can be edited) and issuing a command (such as C-c M or C-c P) directly from there (see the preprocessing commands of this mode and their bindings). 

Note that many useful commands (e.g., to repeat and edit previous commands, interrupt jobs, locate errors, automatic completions, etc.) are available in this top-level window (see @ref{Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers}). 

Often, it is not necessary to use this function since execution of any of the other functions related to the top level (e.g., loading buffers into the top level) ensures that a top level is started (starting one if required).

@node Version control, Generating program documentation, Preprocessing programs, Using Ciao inside GNU emacs
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Version control 

The following commands can be used to carry out a simple but effective form of 
@glindex version control
version control by keeping a 
@glindex log of changes
log of changes on a file or a group of related files. Interestingly, this log is kept in a format that is understood by 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc}, the Ciao documenter [Her99]. As a result, if these version comments are present, then 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc} will be able to automatically assign up to date version numbers to the manuals that it generates. This way it is always possible to identify to which version of the software a manual corresponds. Also, 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc} can create automatically sections describing the changes made since previous versions, which are extracted from the comments in the changelog entries. 

The main effect of these commands is to automatically associate the following information to a set of changes performed in the file and/or in a set of related files: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item a 
@coindex version number
@glindex version number
@emph{version number} (such as, e.g., @code{1.2}, where @code{1} is the 
@glindex major version number
major version number and @code{2} is the 
@glindex minor version number
minor version number), 


@item a 
@glindex patch number
patch number (such as, e.g., the @code{4} in @code{1.2#4}), 


@item a 
@glindex time stamp
time stamp (such as, e.g., @code{1998/12/14,17:20*28+MET}), 


@item the author of the change, 
@coindex change, author
@glindex change, author 
and 


@item a comment explaining the change. 
@coindex change, comment
@glindex change, comment 
@end itemize  

The 
@glindex version numbering
version numbering used can be local to a single file or common to a number of related files. A simple version numbering policy is implemented: when a relevant change is made, the user typically inserts a 
@glindex changelog entry
changelog entry for it, using the appropriate command (or selecting the corresponding option when prompted while saving a file). This will cause the @emph{patch number} for the file (or for the whole system that the file is part of) to be incremented automatically and the corresponding machine-readable comment to be inserted in the file. Major and minor version numbers can also be changed, but this is always invoked by hand (see below). 

The changelog entry is written in the form of a 
@glindex comment/2
@code{comment/2} declaration. As mentioned before, the advantage of using this kind of changelog entries is that these declarations can be processed by the 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc} automatic documenter (see the 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc} reference manual [Her99] or the 
@glindex assertions
@code{assertions} library documentation for more details on these declarations). 

Whether the user is asked or not to introduce such changelog entries, and how the patch and version numbers should be increased is controlled by the presence in the file of a 
@glindex comment/2
@code{comment/2} declaration of the type: 

@code{:- comment(version_maintenance,<type>).} 


@noindent
(note that this requires including the 
@glindex assertions
@code{assertions} library in the source file). These declarations themselves are also typically introduced automatically when using this mode (see below). 

The version maintenance mode can also be set alternatively by inserting a comment such as: 


@smallexample 
%% Local Variables: 
%% mode: ciao
%% update-version-comments: "off"
%% End:
@end smallexample  

The lines above instruct emacs to put the buffer visiting the file in 
@glindex emacs Ciao/Prolog mode
emacs Ciao/Prolog mode and to turn version maintenance off. Setting the version maintenance mode in this way has the disadvantage that 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc}, the auto-documenter, and other related tools will not be aware of the type of version maintenance being performed (the lines above are comments for Prolog). However, this can be useful in fact for setting the 
@coindex version maintenance mode for packages
@glindex version maintenance mode for packages
@emph{version maintenance mode for packages} and other files meant for inclusion in other files, since that way the settings will not affect the file in which the package is included. 

The following commands implement the version control support: 


@table @asis 


@item @key{^X} @key{^S}  
This is the standard 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} command that saves a buffer by writing the contents into the associated @code{.pl} file. However, in Ciao/Prolog mode this command can be set to ask the user before saving whether to introduce a changelog entry documenting the changes performed. 

If the buffer does not already contain a comment specifying the 
@glindex type of version control
type of version control to be performed, and before saving the buffer, the Ciao/Prolog mode prompts the user to choose among the following options: 


@table @asis 


@item @key{q} 
Turn off prompting for the introduction of changelog entries for now. 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} will not ask again while the buffer is loaded, but it will ask again next time you load the buffer. 


@item @key{n} 
Turn off version control for this file. A version control comment such as: 

@code{:- comment(version_maintenance,off).} 


@noindent
is added to the buffer and the file is saved. 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} will not perform any version control on this file until the line above is removed or modified (i.e., from now on C-x C-s simply saves the buffer). 


@item @key{y} 
Turn version control on for this file. 


@end table  

If @key{y} is selected, then the system prompts again regarding how and where the version and patch number information is to be maintained. The following options are available: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{on} 
All version control information will be contained within this file. When saving a buffer (C-x C-s) emacs will ask if a changelog entry should be added to the file before saving. If a comment is entered by the user, a new patch number is assigned to it and the comment is added to the file. This patch number will be the one that follows the most recent changelog entry already in the file. This is obviously useful when maintaining version numbers individually for each file. 


@item @code{<directory_name>} 
Global version control will be performed coherently on several files. When saving a buffer (C-x C-s) emacs will ask if a changelog entry should be added to the file before saving. If a comment is given, the global patch number (which will be kept in the file: @code{<directory_name>/GlobalPatch}) is atomically incremented and the changelog entry is added to the current file, associated to that patch number. Also, a small entry is added to a file @code{<directory_name>/GlobalChangeLog} which points to the current file. This allows inspecting all changes sequentially by visiting all the files where the changes were made (see C-c C-n). This is obviously useful when maintaining a single thread of version and patch numbers for a set of files. 


@item @code{off} 
Turns off version control: C-x C-s then simply saves the file as usual. 


@end table  

@strong{Some useful tips:} 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If a changelog entry is in fact introduced, the cursor is left at the point in the file where the comment was inserted and the mark is left at the original file point. This allows inspecting (and possibly modifying) the changelog entry, and then returning to the original point in the file by simply typing C-x C-x. 


@item 
@coindex moving changelog entries
@glindex moving changelog entries 
The first changelog entry is entered by default at the end of the buffer. Later, the changelog entries can be moved anywhere else in the file. New changelog entries are always inserted just above the first changelog entry which appears in the file. 


@item The comments in changelog entries can be edited at any time. 


@item If a changelog entry is moved to another file, and version numbers are shared by several files through a directory, the corresponding file pointer in the @code{<directory_name>/GlobalChangeLog} file needs to be changed also, for the entry to be locatable later using C-c C-n. 


@end itemize  
 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^S}  
Same as C-x C-s except that it forces prompting for inclusion of a changelog entry even if the buffer is unmodified. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{n}  
Force a move to a new major/minor version number (the user will be prompted for the new numbers). Only applicable if using directory-based version maintenance. Note that otherwise it suffices with introducing a changelog entry in the file and changing its version number by hand. 
@end table  


@table @asis 


@item @key{^C} @key{^N}  
When a unique version numbering is being maintained across several files, this command allows inspecting all changes sequentially by visiting all the files in which the changes were made: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If in a source file, find the next changelog entry in the source file, open in another window the corresponding 
@glindex GlobalChangeLog
@code{GlobalChangeLog} file, and position the cursor at the corresponding entry. This allows browsing the previous and following changes made, which may perhaps reside in other files in the system. 


@item If in a 
@glindex GlobalChangeLog
@code{GlobalChangeLog} file, look for the next entry in the file, and open in another window the source file in which the corresponding comment resides, positioning the corresponding comment at the top of the screen. This allows going through a section of the 
@glindex GlobalChangeLog
@code{GlobalChangeLog} file checking all the corresponding comments in the different files in which they occur.

These commands provide some bindings and facilities for loading programs, which are present in emacs Prolog modes of other Prolog systems (e.g., SICStus). This is useful mainly if the Ciao/Prolog emacs mode is used with such Prolog systems. Note that these commands (
@glindex compile/1
@code{compile/1} and

@code{consult/1}) are deprecated in Ciao (due to the more advanced, separate compilation model in Ciao) and their use in the Ciao top-level is not recommended.

@section Coexistence with other Prolog interfaces 

As mentioned previously, the Ciao/Prolog

@code{emacs} interface (@emph{mode}) can coexist with other Prolog-related 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} interfaces (@emph{modes}) 
@coindex emacs mode, loading several
@glindex emacs mode, loading several 
(such as, e.g., the 
@glindex SICStus
@code{SICStus} Prolog interface). Only one of the interfaces can be active at a time for a given buffer (i.e., for each given file opened inside 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}). In order the change a buffer to a given interface, move the cursor to that buffer and type @code{M-x ...-mode} (e.g., for the Ciao/Prolog mode, @code{M-x ciao-mode}). 

If several Prolog-related 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} interfaces are loaded, then typically the @emph{last} one to be loaded takes precedence, in the sense that this will be the interface in which 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} will be set when opening files which have a @code{.pl} ending (this depends a bit on how things are set up in your @code{.emacs} file).

@section Using Ciao/Prolog mode capabilities in standard shells 

The capabilities (commands, coloring, error location, ...) which are active in the Ciao/Prolog @emph{inferior} mode can also be made available in any standard command line shell which is being run within emacs. This can be enabled by going to the buffer in which the shell is running and typing ``@key{M-x} @code{ciao-inferior-mode}''. This is very useful for example when running the stand-alone compiler, the 
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc} auto-documenter, or even certain user applications (those that use the standard error message library) in an emacs sub-shell. Turning the Ciao/Prolog inferior mode on on that sub-shell will highlight and color the error messages, and automatically find and visit the locations in the files in which the errors are reported. 

Finally, one the most useful applications of this is when using the 
@glindex embedded debugger
embedded debugger (a version of the debugger which can be embedded into executables so that an interactive debugging session can be triggered at any time while running that executable without needing the top-level shell). If an application is run in a shell buffer which has been set with Ciao inferior mode (@key{M-x} @code{ciao-inferior-mode}) and this application starts emitting output from the embedded debugger (i.e., which contains the embedded debugger and is debugging its code) then the Ciao emacs mode will be able to follow these messages, for example tracking execution in the source level code. This also works if the application is written in a combination of languages, provided the parts written in Ciao are compiled with the embedded debugger package and is thus a covenient way of debugging multi-language applications. The only thing needed is to make sure that the output messages appear in a shell buffer that is in Ciao inferior mode.

This section explains all variables used in the Ciao/Prolog emacs mode which can be customized by users. Such customization can be performed (in later versions of 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}) from the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} menus (@code{Help -> Customize -> Top-level Customization Group}), or also by adding a @code{setq} expression in the @code{.emacs} file. Such @code{setq} expression should be similar to: 

@code{(setq <variable> <new_value>)}

The following sections list the different variables which can be customized for 
@glindex ciao
@code{ciao}, 
@glindex ciaopp
@code{ciaopp} and

@subsection Ciao general variables 
@table @asis 
@item @code{ciao-clip-logo} (@emph{file}) 
CLIP logo image. 
@item @code{ciao-create-sample-file-on-startup} (@emph{boolean}) 
When starting the ciao environment using ciao-startup two buffers are opened: one with a Prolog toplevel and another with a sample file. This toggle controls whether the sample file, meant for novice users, is created or not. Set by default, non-novice users will probably want to turn it off. 
@item @code{ciao-indent-width} (@emph{integer}) 
Indentation for a new goal. 
@item @code{ciao-library-path} (@emph{string}) 
Path to the Ciao/Prolog System libraries (reads/sets the CIAOLIB environment variable ). Typically left empty, since ciao executables know which library to use. 
@item @code{ciao-locate-also-note-messages} (@emph{boolean}) 
If set, also when errors of type NOTE are detected the corresponding file is visited and the location marked. It is set to nil by default because sometimes the user prefers not to take any action with respect to these messages (for example, many come from the documenter, indicating that adding certain declarations the documentation would be improved). 
@item @code{ciao-locate-errors-after-run} (@emph{boolean}) 
If set, location of any errors produced when running Ciao tools (loading or preprocessing code, running the documenter, etc.) will be initiated automatically. I.e., after running a command, the system will automatically highlight any error messages and the corresponding areas in source files if possible. If set to nil this location will only happen after typing C-c ` or accessing the corresponding menu or tool bar button. 
@item @code{ciao-logo} (@emph{file}) 
Ciao logo image. 
@item @code{ciao-main-filename} (@emph{string}) 
Name of main file in a multiple module program. Setting thsi is very useful when working on a multi-module program because it allows issuing a load command after working on an inferior module which will reload from the main module, thus also reloading automatically all dependent modules. 
@item @code{ciao-os-shell-prompt-pattern} (@emph{string}) 
Regular expression used to describe the shell prompt pattern, so that error location works in inferior shells. This is useful for example so that errors are located when generating documentation (for lpdoc versions up to 1.9), and also when using the embedded debugger or any other application in a shell. It is best to be as precise as possible when defining this so that the standard ciao error location does not get confused. 
@item @code{ciao-query} (@emph{string}) 
Query to use in Ciao. Setting this is useful when using a long or complicated query because it saves from having to type it over and over again. It is possible to set that this query will be issued any time a program is (re)loaded. 
@item @code{ciao-system} (@emph{string}) 
Name of Ciao or Prolog executable which runs the classical Prolog-like top level. 
@item @code{ciao-system-args} (@emph{string}) 
Arguments passed to Ciao/Prolog toplevel executable. 
@item @code{ciao-toplevel-buffer-name} (@emph{string}) 
Basic name of the buffer running the Ciao/Prolog toplevel inferior process. 
@item @code{ciao-user-directives} (@emph{list})

If opening a file ending with @code{.pl} puts emacs in another mode (such as 
@glindex perl
@code{perl} mode, which is the --arguably incorrect-- default setting in some 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} distributions), then either the emacs mode was not installed or the installation settings are being overwritten by other settings in your @code{.emacs} file or in some library. In any case, you can set things manually so that the Ciao/Prolog mode is loaded by default in your system. This can be done by including in your 
@glindex .emacs
@code{.emacs} file a line such as: 

@code{(load <CIAOLIBDIR>/DOTemacs)} 


@noindent
This loads the above mentioned file from the Ciao library, which contains the following lines (except that the paths are changed during installation to appropriate values for your system):

If you would like to configure things in a different way, you can also copy the contents of this file to your 
@glindex .emacs
@code{.emacs} file and make the appropriate changes. For example, if you do not want @code{.pl} files to be put automatically in Ciao/Prolog mode, then comment out (or remove) the line: 

@code{(setq auto-mode-alist} ... @code{)} 


@noindent
You will then need to switch manually to Ciao/Prolog mode by typing @code{M-x ciao-mode} after opening a Prolog file. 

If you are able to open the Ciao/Prolog menu but the Ciao manuals are not found or the 
@glindex ciao
@code{ciao} command (the top-level) is not found when loading @code{.pl} files, the probable cause is that you do not have the Ciao paths in the @code{INFOPATH} and @code{MANPATH} 
@coindex environment variables
@glindex environment variables
@emph{environment variables} (whether these variables are set automatically or not for users depends on how the Ciao system was installed). Under Un*x, you can add these paths easily by including the line: 

@code{source <CIAOLIBDIR>/DOTcshrc} 


@noindent
in your @code{.login} or @code{.cshrc} files if you are using

@code{csh} (or

Modularity is a basic notion in a modern computer language. Modules allow dividing programs in several parts, which have its own independent name spaces. The module system in Ciao [CH00a], as in many other Prolog implementations, is procedure based. This means that predicate names are local to a module, but functor/atom names in data are shared. 

The predicates visible in a module are the predicates defined in that module, plus the predicates imported from other modules. Only predicates exported by a module can be imported from other modules. The default module of a given predicate name is the local one if the predicate is defined locally, else the last module from which the predicate is imported, having explicit imports priority (that is, a predicate imported by an @code{use_module/2} declaration is always preferred above a predicate imported by an @code{use_module/1} declaration). To refer to a predicate from a module which is not the default for that predicate the name has to be module 
@coindex module qualification
@glindex module qualification
qualified. A module qualified predicate name has the form @code{Module}:@code{Predicate} as in the call @code{debugger:debug_module(M)}. Note that this does not allow having access to predicates not imported, nor defining clauses of other modules. 

All predicates defined in files with no module declaration belong to a special module called 
@coindex user module
@glindex user module 
@code{user}, and all are implicitly exported. This allows dividing programs in several files without being aware of the module system at all. Note that this feature is only supported for compatibility reasons, being its use discouraged. Many attractive compilation features of Ciao cannot be performed in @code{user} modules. 

The case of multifile predicates (defined with the declaration 
@glindex multifile/1
@code{multifile/1}) is also special. Multifile predicates can be defined by clauses distributed in several modules, and all modules which define a predicate as multifile can use that predicate. The name space of multifile predicates is independent, as if they belonged to special module @code{multifile}. 

Every @code{user} or module file imports implicitly a number of modules called 
@glindex builtin modules
builtin modules. They are imported before all other importations of the module, allowing thus redefining any of their predicates (with the exception of 
@glindex true/0
@code{true/0}) by defining local versions or importing them from other modules. Importing explicitly from a builtin module, however, disables the implicit importation of the rest (this feature is used by package 
@glindex library(pure)
@code{library(pure)} to define pure prolog code).

This chapter documents the basic 
@glindex builtin directives
builtin directives in Ciao, additional to the documented in other chapters. These 
@glindex directives
directives are natively interpreted by the Ciao compiler (
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}). 

Unlike in other Prolog systems, directives in Ciao are not goals to be @emph{executed} by the compiler or top level. Instead, they are @emph{read} and acted upon by these programs. The advantage of this is that the effect of the directives is consistent for executables, code loaded in the top level, code analyzed by the preprocessor, etc. 

As a result, by default only the builtin directives or declarations defined in this manual can be used in user programs. However, it is possible to define new declarations 
@coindex declarations, user defined
@glindex declarations, user defined 
using the 
@glindex new_declaration/1
@code{new_declaration/1} and 
@glindex new_declaration/2
@code{new_declaration/2} directives (or using packages including them). Also, packages may define new directives via code translations.

@glindex properties, basic 
This library contains the set of basic properties used by the builtin predicates, and which constitute the basic data types and properties of the language. They can be used both as type testing builtins within programs (by calling them explicitly) and as properties in assertions.

This library contains traditional Prolog predicates for testing types. They depend on the state of instantiation of their arguments, thus being of extra-logical nature.

These built-in predicates are extra-logical. They treat uninstantiated variables as objects with values which may be compared, and they never instantiate those variables. They should @emph{not} be used when what you really want is arithmetic comparison or unification. 

The predicates make reference to a 
@coindex standard total ordering
@glindex standard total ordering
@emph{standard total ordering} of terms, which is as follows: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Variables, by age (roughly, oldest first -- the order is @emph{not} related to the names of variables). 


@item Floats, in numeric order (e.g. -1.0 is put before 1.0). 


@item Integers, in numeric order (e.g. -1 is put before 1). 


@item Atoms, in alphabetical (i.e. character code) order. 


@item Compound terms, ordered first by arity, then by the name of the principal functor, then by the arguments in left-to-right order. Recall that lists are equivalent to compound terms with principal functor @code{'.'/2}. 


@end itemize  

For example, here is a list of terms in standard order: 


@smallexample 
[ X, -1.0, -9, 1, bar, foo, [1], X = Y, foo(0,2), bar(1,1,1) ]
@end smallexample

The Ciao system provides builtin predicates which allow dealing with names of constants (atoms or numbers). Note that sometimes strings (character code lists) are more suitable to handle sequences of characters.

@code{String} is the list of the ASCII codes of the characters comprising the name of @code{Const}. Note that if @code{Const} is an atom whose name can be interpreted as a number (e.g. '96'), the predicate is not reversible, as that atom will not be constructed when @code{Const} is uninstantiated. Thus it is recommended that new programs use the ISO-compliant predicates 
@glindex atom_codes/2
@code{atom_codes/2} or 
@glindex number_codes/2
@code{number_codes/2}, as these predicates do not have this inconsistency.

Arithmetic is performed by built-in predicates which take as arguments arithmetic expressions (see 
@glindex arithexpression/1
@code{arithexpression/1}) and evaluate them. Terms representing arithmetic expressions can be created dynamically, but at the time of evaluation, each variable in an arithmetic expression must be bound to a non-variable expression (the term must be ground). For example, given the code in the first line a possible shell interaction follows: 
@smallexample 
evaluate(Expression, Answer) :- Answer is Expression.

?- _X=24*9, evaluate(_X+6, Ans).

Ans = 222 ?

yes

An arithmetic expression is a term built from numbers and 
@glindex evaluable functors
evaluable functors that represent arithmetic functions. An arithmetic expression evaluates to a number, which may be an integer (
@glindex int/1
@code{int/1}) or a float (
@glindex flt/1
@code{flt/1}). The evaluable functors allowed in an arithmetic expression are listed below, together with an indication of the functions they represent. All evaluable functors defined in 
@glindex ISO-Prolog
ISO-Prolog are implemented, as well as some other useful or traditional. Unless stated otherwise, an expression evaluates to a float if any of its arguments is a float, otherwise to an integer.

quoted string is just a list of integers, this allows a quoted character to be used in place of its 
@glindex ASCII code
ASCII code; e.g. @code{"A"} behaves within arithmetic expressions as the integer 65. Note that this is not 
@coindex ISO-Prolog
@glindex ISO-Prolog
ISO-compliant, and that can be achieved by using the ISO notation @code{0'A}. 

Arithmetic expressions, as described above, are just data structures. If you want one evaluated you must pass it as an argument to one of the arithmetic predicates defined in this library.

@item @code{lock} 
Try to set an advisory lock for the file. If the open mode is @code{read}, the lock is a read (shared) lock, else it is a write (exclusive) lock. If the lock cannot be acquired, the call waits until it is released (but can fail in exceptional cases). 


@item @code{lock_nb} 
Same as @code{lock}, but the call immediately fails if the lock cannot be acquired. 


@item @code{lock(Lock_Mode)} 
Same as @code{lock}, but specifying in @code{Lock_Mode} whether the lock is @code{read} (also @code{shared}) or @code{write} (also @code{exclusive}). This option has be included for compatibility with the SWI-Prolog locking options, because in general the type of lock should match the open mode as in the @code{lock} option. 


@item @code{lock_nb(Lock_Mode)} 
Same as the previous option but with the @code{lock_nb} behavior.

A source name is a flexible way of referring to a concrete file. A source name is either a relative or absolute filename given as: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item an atom, or 


@item a unary functor (which represents a 
@coindex path alias
@glindex path alias
@emph{path alias}, see below) applied to a @emph{relative} path, the latter being given as an atom. 


@end itemize  

In all cases certain filename extensions (e.g., @code{.pl}) can be implicit. In the first form above, file names can be relative to the current directory. Also, file names beginning with @code{~} or @code{$} are treated specially. For example, 


@table @asis 


@item @code{'~/ciao/sample.pl'} 
is equivalent to @code{'/home/staff/herme/ciao/sample.pl'}, if @code{/home/staff/herme} is the user's home directory. (This is also equivalent to @code{'$HOME/ciao/sample.pl'} as explained below.) 


@item @code{'~bardo/prolog/sample.pl'} 
is equivalent to @code{'/home/bardo/prolog/sample.pl'}, if @code{/home/bardo} is bardo's home directory. 


@item @code{'$UTIL/sample.pl'} 
is equivalent to @code{'/usr/local/src/utilities/sample.pl'}, if @code{/usr/local/src/utilities} is the value of the environment variable @code{UTIL}. 


@end table  

The second form allows using path aliases. Such aliases allow refering to files not with absolute file system paths but with paths which are relative to predefined (or user-defined) abstract names. For example, given the path alias @code{myutils} which has been defined to refer to path @code{'/home/bardo/utilities'}, if that directory contains the file @code{stuff.pl} then the term @code{myutils(stuff)} in a 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1} declaration would refer to the file @code{'/home/bardo/utilities/stuff.pl'} (the @code{.pl} extension is implicit in the 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1} declaration). As a special case, if that directory contains a subdirectory named @code{stuff} which in turn contains the file @code{stuff.pl}, the same term would refer to the file @code{'/home/bardo/utilities/stuff/stuff.pl'}. If a path alias is related to several paths, all paths are scanned in sequence until a match is found. For information on predefined path aliases or how to define new path aliases, see 
@glindex file_search_path/2
@code{file_search_path/2}.

This module provides predicates for character input/output and for canonical term output. From the 
@glindex ISO-Prolog
ISO-Prolog predicates for character input/output, only the @code{_code} versions are provided, the rest are given by 
@glindex library(iso_byte_char)
@code{library(iso_byte_char)}, using these. Most predicates are provided in two versions: one that specifies the input or output stream as the first argument and a second which omits this argument and uses the current input or output stream.

Executes @code{Goal}. If an exception is raised during its execution, @code{Error} is unified with the exception, and if the unification succeeds, the entire execution derived from @code{Goal} is aborted, and @code{Handler} is executed. The execution resumes with the continuation of the catch/3 call. For example, given the code 
@smallexample 
p(X) :- throw(error), display('---').
p(X) :- display(X).
@end smallexample  
the execution of "@code{catch(p(0), E, display(E)), display(.), fail.}" results in the output "@code{error.}".

@glindex catch/3

@coindex prolog flag
@glindex prolog flag 
Flags define some parameters of the system and control the behavior of system or library predicates. Each flag has a name and an associated predefined value, and except some system flags which are fixed in general their associated value is changeable. Predefined flags in the system are: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{version} 
The Ciao version, as a term @code{ciao}(@code{Version},@code{Patch}). @code{Version} is a floating point number, @code{Patch} is an integer. Unchangeable. 


@item @code{argv} 
Its value is a list of atoms representing the program arguments supplied when the current executable was invoked. This is the value to which is instantiated the argument of the 
@glindex main/1
@code{main/1} predicate at executable startup. Unchangeable. 


@item @code{bounded} 
It is @code{false}, to denote that the range of integers can be considered infinite (but see 
@glindex int/1
@code{int/1}). Unchangeable. @key{ @bullet{} ISO @bullet{} }


@item @code{fileerrors} 
If @code{on}, predicates handling files give errors (throw exceptions) when a file is inexistent or an operation is not allowed. If @code{off}, fail in that conditions. Initially @code{on}. 


@item @code{gc} 
Controls whether garbage collection is done. May be @code{on} (default) or @code{off}. 


@item @code{gc_margin} 
An integer @code{Margin}. If less than @code{Margin} kilobytes are reclaimed in a garbage collection then the size of the garbage collected area should be increased. Also, no garbage collection is attempted unless the garbage collected area has at least @code{Margin} kilobytes. Initially 500. 


@item @code{gc_trace} 
Governs garbage collection trace messages. An element off @code{[on,off,terse,verbose]}. Initially @code{off}. 


@item @code{integer_rounding_function} 
It is @code{toward_zero}, so that @code{-1 =:= -3//2} succeeds. Unchangeable. @key{ @bullet{} ISO @bullet{} }


@item @code{max_arity} 
It is 255, so that no compound term (or predicate) can have more than this number of arguments. Unchangeable. @key{ @bullet{} ISO @bullet{} }


@item @code{quiet} 
Controls which messages issued using 
@glindex io_aux
@code{io_aux} are actually written. As the system uses that library to report its messages, this flag controls the @emph{verbosity} of the system. Possible states of the flag are: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{on} 
No messages are reported. 


@item @code{error} 
Only error messages are reported. 


@item @code{warning} 
Only error and warning messages are reported. 


@item @code{off} 
All messages are reported, except debug messages. This is the default state. 


@item @code{debug} 
All messages, including debug messages, are reported. This is only intended for the system implementators. 


@end table  


@item @code{unknown} 
Controls action on calls to undefined predicates. The possible states of the flag are: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{error} 
An error is thrown with the 
@glindex error term
error term @code{existence_error(procedure, F/A)}. 


@item @code{fail} 
The call simply fails. 


@item @code{warning} 
A warning is written and the call fails. 


@end table  

The state is initially @code{error}. @key{ @bullet{} ISO @bullet{} }


@end table

@coindex data predicate
@glindex data predicate
Prolog implementations traditionally implement the concept of 
@glindex dynamic predicate
dynamic predicates: predicates which can be inspected or modified at run-time, adding or deleting individual clauses. The power of this feature comes at a cost: as new clause bodies can be arbitrarily added to the program, new predicate calls can arise which are not 'visible' at compile-time, thus complicating global analysis and optimization of the code. But it is the case that most of the time what the programmer wants is simply to store data, with the purpose of sharing it between search branches, predicates, or even execution threads. In Ciao the concept of data predicate serves this purpose: a data predicate is a predicate composed exclusively by facts, which can be inspected, and dynamically added or deleted, at run-time. Using data predicates instead of normal dynamic predicates brings benefits in terms of speed, but above all makes the code much easier to analyze automatically and thus allows better optimization.
@coindex concurrent predicate
@glindex concurrent predicate 
@coindex data declaration
@glindex data declaration 

Also, a special kind of data predicates exists, 
@coindex concurrent predicates
@glindex concurrent predicates
@emph{concurrent predicates}, which can be used to communicate/synchronize among different execution threads (see @ref{Low-level concurrency/multithreading primitives}). 

Data predicates must be declared through a 
@glindex data/1
@code{data/1} declaration. Concurrent data predicates must be declared through a 
@glindex concurrent/1
@code{concurrent/1} declaration.

Note that 
@glindex combine_attributes/2
@code{combine_attributes/2} and 
@glindex verify_attribute/2
@code{verify_attribute/2} are not called with the attributed variables involved, but with the corresponding attributes instead. The reasons are: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item There are simple applications which only refer to the attributes. 


@item If the application wants to refer to the attributed variables themselves, they can be made part the attribute term. The implementation of 
@glindex freeze/2
@code{freeze/2} utilizes this technique. Note that this does not lead to cyclic structures, as the connection between an attributed variable and its attribute is invisible to the pure parts of the Prolog implementation. 


@item If attributed variables were passed as arguments, the user code would have to refer to the attributes through an extra call to 
@glindex get_attribute/2
@code{get_attribute/2}. 


@item As the/one attribute is the first argument to each of the two predicates, indexing applies. Note that attributed variables themselves look like variables to the indexing mechanism. 


@end itemize  

However, future improvements may change or extend the interface to attributed variables in order to provide a richer and more expressive interface. 

For customized output of attributed variables, please refer to the documentation of the predicate 
@glindex portray_attribute/2
@code{portray_attribute/2}.

To simplify the use of Ciao Prolog to the 
@glindex first-timers
first-timers, some other predicates and features are defined by default in normal cases, to provide more or less what other prologs define by default. Here are explicitly listed the predicates defined, coming from several libraries. Apart from those, the features defined in @ref{Definite clause grammars} and @ref{Enabling operators at run-time} are also activated.

No need of explicit loading. It is included by default in modules starting with a

@glindex use_package/1
@code{use_package/1} declaration. In the Ciao shell, it is loaded by default when no

This module implements the standard solution aggregation predicates. 

When there are many solutions to a problem, and when all those solutions are required to be collected together, this can be achieved by repeatedly backtracking and gradually building up a list of the solutions. The following built-in predicates are provided to automate this process.

@code{setof(Template, Generator, Set)}


Finds the @code{Set} of instances of the @code{Template} satisfying @code{Generator}. The set is in ascending order (see @ref{Comparing terms} for a definition of this order) without duplicates, and is non-empty. If there are no solutions, @code{setof} fails. @code{setof} may succeed in more than one way, binding free variables in @code{Generator} to different values. This can be avoided by using existential quantifiers on the free variables in front of @code{Generator}, using 
@glindex ^/2
@code{^/2}. For example, given the clauses: 
@smallexample 
father(bill, tom).
father(bill, ann).
father(bill, john).
father(harry, july).
father(harry, daniel).
@end smallexample  

The following query produces two alternative solutions via backtracking: 
@smallexample 
?- setof(X,father(F,X),Sons).

F = bill,
Sons = [ann,john,tom] ? ;

F = harry,
Sons = [daniel,july] ? ;

@code{bagof(Template, Generator, Bag)}


Finds all the instances of the @code{Template} produced by the @code{Generator}, and returns them in the @code{Bag} in the order in which they were found. If the @code{Generator} contains free variables which are not bound in the @code{Template}, it assumes that this is like any other Prolog question and that you want bindings for those variables. This can be avoided by using existential quantifiers on the free variables in front of the @code{Generator}, using

This module implements the assert/retract family of predicates to manipulate dynamic predicates. 

The predicates defined in this module allow modification of the program as it is actually running. Clauses can be added to the program (@emph{asserted}) or removed from the program (@emph{retracted}). For these predicates, the argument which corresponds to the clause head must be instantiated to an atom or a compound term. The argument corresponding to the clause must be instantiated either to a term @code{Head :- Body} or, if the body part is empty, to @code{Head}. An empty body part is represented as @code{true}. Note that using this library is very detrimental to global analysis, and that for most uses the predicates listed in @ref{Fast/concurrent update of facts} suffice.

@strong{Author(s):} First versions from SICStus 0.6 code; additional changes and documentation by Daniel Cabeza and Manuel Carro.

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#289 (2004/2/13, 19:46:27 CET)

This module provides falicities to read terms in Prolog syntax. This is very convenient in many cases (and not only if you are writing a Prolog compiler), because Prolog terms are easy to write and can convey a lot of information in a human-readable fashion.

@strong{Author(s):} Adapted from shared code written by Richard A. O'Keefe. Changes by Mats Carlsson, Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo, and Manuel Carro..

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#290 (2004/2/13, 20:20:3 CET)

This library provides different predicates for term output, additional to the kernel predicates 
@glindex display/1
@code{display/1}-
@glindex display/2
@code{display/2} and @code{displayq/1}-@code{displayq/2}. All the predicates defined in ISO-Prolog are included, plus other traditionally provided by Prolog Implementations. Output predicates are provided in two versions: one that uses the current output stream and other in which the stream is specified explicitly, as an additional first argument.

@deffn PROPERTY write_option/1:



@code{Opt} is a valid write option which affects the predicate @code{write_term/3} and similar ones. Possible write_options are: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item @strong{quoted(}@emph{bool}@strong{):} If @emph{bool} is @code{true}, atoms and functors that can't be read back by 
@glindex read_term/3
@code{read_term/3} are quoted, if it is @code{false}, each atom and functor is written as its name. Default value is @code{false}. 


@item @strong{ignore_ops(}@emph{flag}@strong{):} If @emph{flag} is @code{true}, each compound term is output in functional notation, if it is @code{ops}, curly bracketed notation and list notation is enabled when outputing compound terms, if it is @code{false}, also operator notation is enabled when outputing compound terms. Default value is @code{false}. 


@item @strong{numbervars(}@emph{bool}@strong{):} If @emph{bool} is @code{true}, a term of the form @code{'$VAR'(N)} where @code{N} is an integer, is output as a variable name consisting of a capital letter possibly followed by an integer, a term of the form @code{'$VAR'(Atom)} where @code{Atom} is an atom, as this atom (without quotes), and a term of the form @code{'$VAR'(String)} where @code{String} is a character string, as the atom corresponding to this character string. See predicates @code{numbervars/3} and @code{prettyvars/1}. If @emph{bool} is @code{false} this cases are not treated in any special way. Default value is @code{false}. 


@item @strong{portrayed(}@emph{bool}@strong{):} If @emph{bool} is @code{true}, then call multifile predicates 
@glindex portray/1
@code{portray/1} and 
@glindex portray_attribute/2
@code{portray_attribute/2}, to provide the user handlers for pretty printing some terms. @code{portray_attribute/2} is called whenever an attributed variable is to be printed, @code{portray/1} is called whenever a non-variable term is to be printed. If either call succeeds, then it is assumed that the term has been output, else it is printed as usual. If @emph{bool} is @code{false}, these predicates are not called. Default value is @code{false}. This option is set by the toplevel when writting the final values of variables, and by the debugging package when writting the goals in the tracing messages. Thus you can vary the forms of these messages if you wish. 


@item @strong{max_depth(}@emph{depth}@strong{):} @emph{depth} is a positive integer or cero. If it is positive, it denotes the depth limit on printing compound terms. If it is cero, there is no limit. Default value is @code{0} (no limit). 


@item @strong{priority(}@emph{prio}@strong{):} @emph{prio} is an integer between 1 and 1200. If the term to be printed has higher priority than @emph{prio}, it will be printed parenthesized. Default value is 1200 (no term parenthesized).

This part documents some Ciao libraries which provide additional predicates and functionalities that, despite not being in the ISO standard, are present in many popular Prolog systems. This includes definite clause grammars (DCGs), ``Quintus-style'' internal database, list processing predicates, DEC-10 Prolog-style input/output, formatted output, dynamic loading of modules, activation of operators at run-time, etc.

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#209 (2003/12/21, 2:5:22 CET)

This library package allows the use of DCGs (Definite Clause Grammars) [Col78,PW80] in a Ciao module/program. 

Definite clause grammars are an extension of the well-known context-free grammars. Prolog's grammar rules provide a convenient notation for expressing definite clause grammars. A DCG rule in Prolog takes the general form 


@smallexample 
@code{head} --> @code{body}.
@end smallexample  


@noindent
meaning ``a possible form for @code{head} is @code{body}''. Both @code{body} and @code{head} are sequences of one or more items linked by the standard Prolog conjunction operator "@code{,}". 

Definite clause grammars extend context-free grammars in the following ways: 


@enumerate  


@item A non-terminal symbol may be any Prolog term (other than a variable or number). 


@item A terminal symbol may be any Prolog term. To distinguish terminals from non-terminals, a sequence of one or more terminal symbols is written within a grammar rule as a Prolog list. An empty sequence is written as the empty list @code{[]}. If the terminal symbols are ASCII character codes, such lists can be written (as elsewhere) as strings. An empty sequence is written as the empty list, @code{[]} or @code{""}. 


@item Extra conditions, in the form of Prolog procedure calls, may be included in the right-hand side of a grammar rule. Such procedure calls are written enclosed in @code{@{@}} brackets. 


@item The left-hand side of a grammar rule consists of a non-terminal, optionally followed by a sequence of terminals (again written as a Prolog list). 


@item Alternatives may be stated explicitly in the right-hand side of a grammar rule, using the disjunction operator @code{;}, or, also, as traditionally in Prolog, using @code{|} (which is treated specially when this package is loaded). 


@item The cut symbol may be included in the right-hand side of a grammar rule, as in a Prolog clause. The cut symbol does not need to be enclosed in @code{@{@}} brackets. 
@end enumerate  

As an example, here is a simple grammar which parses an arithmetic expression (made up of digits and operators) and computes its value. 


@smallexample 
expr(Z) --> term(X), "+", expr(Y), @{Z is X + Y@}.
expr(Z) --> term(X), "-", expr(Y), @{Z is X - Y@}.
expr(X) --> term(X).

term(Z) --> number(X), "*", term(Y), @{Z is X * Y@}.
term(Z) --> number(X), "/", term(Y), @{Z is X / Y@}.
term(Z) --> number(Z).

number(C) --> "+", number(C).
number(C) --> "-", number(X), @{C is -X@}.
number(X) --> [C], @{0'0=<C, C=<0'9, X is C - 0'0@}.
@end smallexample  

In the last rule, @code{C} is the ASCII code of some digit. 

The query 


@smallexample 
?- expr(Z, "-2+3*5+1", []).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will compute @code{Z}=14. The two extra arguments are explained below. 

Now, in fact, grammar rules are merely a convenient ``syntactic sugar'' for ordinary Prolog clauses. Each grammar rule takes an input string, analyses some initial portion, and produces the remaining portion (possibly enlarged) as output for further analysis. The arguments required for the input and output strings are not written explicitly in a grammar rule, but the syntax implicitly defines them. We now show how to translate grammar rules into ordinary clauses by making explicit the extra arguments. 

A rule such as 


@smallexample 
p(X) --> q(X).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
translates into 


@smallexample 
p(X, S0, S) :- q(X, S0, S).
@end smallexample  

If there is more than one non-terminal on the right-hand side, as in 


@smallexample 
p(X, Y) --> 
        q(X), 
        r(X, Y),
        s(Y).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
then corresponding input and output arguments are identified, as in 


@smallexample 
p(X, Y, S0, S) :- 
        q(X, S0, S1), 
        r(X, Y, S1, S2), 
        r(Y, S2, S).
@end smallexample  

Terminals are translated using the built-in predicate @code{'C'/3} (this predicate is not normally useful in itself; it has been given the name @code{'C'} simply to avoid using up a more useful name). Then, for instance 


@smallexample 
p(X) --> [go,to], q(X), [stop].
@end smallexample  


@noindent
is translated by 


@smallexample 
p(X, S0, S) :-
        'C'(S0, go, S1), 
        'C'(S1, to, S2), 
        q(X, S2, S3), 
        'C'(S3, stop, S).
@end smallexample  

Extra conditions expressed as explicit procedure calls naturally translate as themselves, e.g. 


@smallexample 
p(X) --> [X], @{integer(X), X>0@}, q(X).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
translates to 


@smallexample 
p(X, S0, S) :- 
        'C'(S0, X, S1), 
        integer(X), 
        X>0, 
        q(X, S1, S).
@end smallexample  

Similarly, a cut is translated literally. 

Terminals on the left-hand side of a rule translate into an explicit list in the output argument of the main non-terminal, e.g. 


@smallexample 
is(N), [not] --> [aint].
@end smallexample  


@noindent
becomes 


@smallexample 
is(N, S0, [not|S]) :- 'C'(S0, aint, S).
@end smallexample  

Disjunction has a fairly obvious translation, e.g. 


@smallexample 
args(X, Y) --> 
        (   dir(X), [to], indir(Y)
        ;   indir(Y), dir(X)
        ).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
translates to 


@smallexample 
args(X, Y, S0, S) :-
        (   dir(X, S0, S1), 
            'C'(S1, to, S2), 
            indir(Y, S2, S)
        ;   indir(Y, S0, S1), 
            dir(X, S1, S)

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#212 (2003/12/21, 2:18:19 CET)

The @code{format} family of predicates is due to Quintus Prolog. They act as a Prolog interface to the C @code{stdio} function @code{printf()}, allowing formatted output. 

Output is formatted according to an output pattern which can have either a format control sequence or any other character, which will appear verbatim in the output. Control sequences act as place-holders for the actual terms that will be output. Thus 
@smallexample 
        ?- format("Hello ~q!",world).
        @end smallexample  
@noindent
will print @code{Hello world!}. 

If there is only one item to print it may be supplied alone. If there are more they have to be given as a list. If there are none then an empty list should be supplied. There has to be as many items as control characters. 

The character @code{~} introduces a control sequence. To print a @code{~} verbatim just repeat it: 
@smallexample 
        ?- format("Hello ~~world!", []).
        @end smallexample  
@noindent
will result in @code{Hello ~world!}. 

A format may be spread over several lines. The control sequence @code{\c} followed by a @key{LFD} will translate to the empty string: 
@smallexample 
        ?- format("Hello \c
        world!", []).
        @end smallexample  
@noindent
will result in @code{Hello world!}.

@deffn REGTYPE format_control/1:



 The general format of a control sequence is @code{~@code{N}@code{C}}. The character @code{C} determines the type of the control sequence. @code{N} is an optional numeric argument. An alternative form of @code{N} is @code{*}. @code{*} implies that the next argument in @code{Arguments} should be used as a numeric argument in the control sequence. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello~4cworld!", [0'x]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
and 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello~*cworld!", [4,0'x]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
both produce 


@smallexample 
Helloxxxxworld!
@end smallexample  

The following control sequences are available. 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item ~a The argument is an atom. The atom is printed without quoting. 


@item ~@code{N}c (Print character.) The argument is a number that will be interpreted as an ASCII code. @code{N} defaults to one and is interpreted as the number of times to print the character. 


@item ~@code{N}e 
@item ~@code{N}E 
@item ~@code{N}f 
@item ~@code{N}g 
@item ~@code{N}G (Print float). The argument is a float. The float and @code{N} will be passed to the C @code{printf()} function as 


@smallexample 
printf("%.@code{N}e", @code{Arg})
printf("%.@code{N}E", @code{Arg})
printf("%.@code{N}f", @code{Arg})
printf("%.@code{N}g", @code{Arg})
printf("%.@code{N}G", @code{Arg})
@end smallexample  

If @code{N} is not supplied the action defaults to 


@smallexample 
printf("%e", @code{Arg})
printf("%E", @code{Arg})
printf("%f", @code{Arg})
printf("%g", @code{Arg})
printf("%G", @code{Arg})
@end smallexample  


@item ~@code{N}d (Print decimal.) The argument is an integer. @code{N} is interpreted as the number of digits after the decimal point. If @code{N} is 0 or missing, no decimal point will be printed. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~1d world!", [42]).
?- format("Hello ~d world!", [42]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello 4.2 world!
Hello 42 world!
@end smallexample  


@noindent
respectively. 


@item ~@code{N}D (Print decimal.) The argument is an integer. Identical to @code{~@code{N}d} except that @code{,} will separate groups of three digits to the left of the decimal point. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~1D world!", [12345]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello 1,234.5 world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~@code{N}r (Print radix.) The argument is an integer. @code{N} is interpreted as a radix. @code{N} should be >= 2 and <= 36. If @code{N} is missing the radix defaults to 8. The letters @code{a-z} will denote digits larger than 9. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~2r world!", [15]).
?- format("Hello ~16r world!", [15]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello 1111 world!
Hello f world!
@end smallexample  


@noindent
respectively. 


@item ~@code{N}R (Print radix.) The argument is an integer. Identical to @code{~@code{N}r} except that the letters @code{A-Z} will denote digits larger than 9. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~16R world!", [15]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello F world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~@code{N}s (Print string.) The argument is a list of ASCII codes. Exactly @code{N} characters will be printed. @code{N} defaults to the length of the string. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~4s ~4s!", ["new","world"]).
?- format("Hello ~s world!", ["new"]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello new  worl!
Hello new world!
@end smallexample  


@noindent
respectively. 


@item ~i (Ignore argument.) The argument may be of any type. The argument will be ignored. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~i~s world!", ["old","new"]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello new world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~k (Print canonical.) The argument may be of any type. The argument will be passed to @code{write_canonical/2} (@ref{Term output}). Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~k world!", [[a,b,c]]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello .(a,.(b,.(c,[]))) world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~p (print.) The argument may be of any type. The argument will be passed to @code{print/2} (@ref{Term output}). Example: 


@noindent
suposing the user has defined the predicate 


@smallexample 
:- multifile portray/1.
portray([X|Y]) :- print(cons(X,Y)).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
then 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~p world!", [[a,b,c]]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello cons(a,cons(b,cons(c,[]))) world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~q (Print quoted.) The argument may be of any type. The argument will be passed to @code{writeq/2} (@ref{Term output}). Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~q world!", [['A','B']]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello ['A','B'] world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~w (write.) The argument may be of any type. The argument will be passed to @code{write/2} (@ref{Term output}). Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~w world!", [['A','B']]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello [A,B] world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~@code{N}n (Print newline.) Print @code{N} newlines. @code{N} defaults to 1. Example: 


@smallexample 
?- format("Hello ~n world!", []).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
will print as 


@smallexample 
Hello
 world!
@end smallexample  


@item ~N (Fresh line.) Print a newline, if not already at the beginning of a line. 


@item ~~ (Print tilde.) Prints @code{~} 


@end itemize  
 
The following control sequences are also available for compatibility, but do not perform any useful functions. 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item ~@code{N}| (Set tab.) Set a tab stop at position @code{N}, where @code{N} defaults to the current position, and advance the current position there. 


@item ~@code{N}+ (Advance tab.) Set a tab stop at @code{N} positions past the current position, where @code{N} defaults to 8, and advance the current position there. 


@item ~@code{N}t (Set fill character.) Set the fill character to be used in the next position movement to @code{N}, where @code{N} defaults to @key{SPC}.

This module contains predicates for invoking services which are typically provided by the operating system. Note that the predicates which take names of files or directories as arguments in this module expect atoms, not 
@glindex path alias
path aliases. I.e., generally these predicates will not call 
@glindex absolute_file_name/2
@code{absolute_file_name/2} on names of files or directories taken as arguments.

When called with free variables, @code{StdIn}, @code{StdOut}, and @code{StdErr} are instantiated to streams connected to the standard output, input, and error of the created process. @code{Background} controls whether the caller waits for @code{Command} to finish, or if the process executing @code{Command} is completely detached (it can be waited for using 
@glindex wait/3
@code{wait/3}). @code{ErrCode} is the error code returned by the lower-level @code{exec()} system call (this return code is system-dependent, but a non-zero value usually means that something has gone wrong). If @code{Command} does not start by a slash, 
@glindex exec/8
@code{exec/8} uses the environment variable @code{PATH} to search for it. If @code{PATH} is not set, @code{/bin} and @code{/usr/bin} are searched.

@glindex shell/n
@code{shell/n} commands have a bug in Windows: if the environment variable SHELL is instantiated to some Windows shell implementation, then it is very possible that shell/@{1,2@} will not work, as it is always called with the -c flag to start the user command. For example, COMMAND.COM @strong{might} need the flag /C -- but there is no way to know a priori which command line option is necessary for every shell! It does not seems usual that Windows sets the SHELL environment variable: if it is not set, we set it up at startup time to point to the @code{sh.exe} provided with Ciao, which is able to start Windows aplications. Therefore, @code{?- shell('command.com').} just works.

@item
If 
@glindex exec/4
@code{exec/4} does not find the command to be executed, there is no visible error message: it is sent to a error output which has already been assigned to a different stream, disconnected from the one the user sees.

If the arguments to cyg2win/3 are not strings, strange results appear, as a very mild type checking is performed.

@strong{Author(s):} The CLIP Group.

@strong{Version:} 1.9#213 (2003/12/21, 2:20:13 CET)

 The predicates described in this section were introduced in early implementations of Prolog to provide efficient means of performing operations on large quantities of data. The introduction of indexed dynamic predicates have rendered these predicates obsolete, and the sole purpose of providing them is to support existing code. There is no reason whatsoever to use them in new code. 

These predicates store arbitrary terms in the database without interfering with the clauses which make up the program. The terms which are stored in this way can subsequently be retrieved via the key on which they were stored. Many terms may be stored on the same key, and they can be individually accessed by pattern matching. Alternatively, access can be achieved via a special identifier which uniquely identifies each recorded term and which is returned when the term is stored.

The term @code{Term} is recorded in the internal database as the first item for the key @code{Key}, where @code{Ref} is its implementation-defined identifier. The key must be given, and only its principal functor is significant. Any uninstantiated variables in the @code{Term} will be replaced by new private variables, along with copies of any subgoals blocked on these variables.

At the same time, @code{Ref} is unified with the implementation-defined identifier uniquely identifying the recorded item. If the key is instantiated to a compound term, only its principal functor is significant.

The 
@glindex assertions
@code{assertions} package adds a number of new declaration definitions and new operator definitions which allow including 
@glindex program assertions
program assertions in user programs. Such assertions can be used to describe predicates, properties, modules, applications, etc. These descriptions can be formal specifications (such as preconditions and post-conditions) or machine-readable textual comments. 

This module is part of the 
@glindex assertions
@code{assertions} library. It defines the basic code-related assertions, i.e., those intended to be used mainly by compilation-related tools, such as the static analyzer or the run-time test generator. 

Giving 
@glindex specifications
specifications for predicates and other program elements is the main functionality documented here. The exact syntax of comments 
@coindex comments, machine readable
@glindex comments, machine readable 
is described in the autodocumenter (
@glindex lpdoc
@code{lpdoc} [Knu84,Her99]) manual, although some support for adding machine-readable comments in assertions is also mentioned here. 

There are two kinds of assertions: predicate assertions and program point assertions. All predicate assertions are currently placed as directives in the source code, i.e., preceded by ``@code{:-}''. Program point assertions are placed as goals in clause bodies.

@section More info 

The facilities provided by the library are documented in the description of its component modules. This documentation is intended to provide information only at a ``reference manual'' level. For a more tutorial introduction to the subject and some more examples please see the document ``An Assertion Language for Debugging of Constraint Logic Programs (Technical Report CLIP2/97.1)''. The assertion language implemented in this library is modeled after this design document, although, due to implementation issues, it may differ in some details. The purpose of this manual is to document precisely what the implementation of the library supports at any given point in time.

@item @strong{Formatting commands within text strings:} 
@coindex formatting commands
@glindex formatting commands 
many of the predicates defined in these modules include arguments intended for providing textual information. This includes titles, descriptions, comments, etc. The type of this argument is a character string. In order for the automatic generation of documentation to work correctly, this 
@glindex character string
character string should adhere to certain conventions. See the description of the 
@glindex docstring/1
@code{docstring/1} type/grammar for details. 


@item @strong{Referring to variables:} In order for the automatic documentation system to work correctly, 
@glindex variable names
variable names (for example, when referring to arguments in the head patterns of @emph{pred} declarations) must be surrounded by an @code{@@var} command. For example, @code{@@var@{VariableName@}} should be used for referring to the variable ``VariableName'', which will appear then formatted as follows: @code{VariableName}. See the description of the 
@glindex docstring/1
@code{docstring/1} type/grammar for details.

@glindex pred assertion 
This assertion provides information on a predicate. The body of the assertion (its only argument) contains properties or comments in the formats defined by 
@glindex assrt_body/1
@code{assrt_body/1}. 

More than one of these assertions may appear per predicate, in which case each one represents a possible ``
@glindex mode
mode'' of use (
@glindex usage
usage) of the predicate. The exact scope of the usage is defined by the properties given for calls in the body of each assertion (which should thus distinguish the different usages intended). All of them together cover all possible modes of usage. 

For example, the following assertions describe (all the and the only) modes of usage of predicate @code{length/2} (see 
@glindex lists
@code{lists}): 
@smallexample 
:- pred length(L,N) : list * var => list * integer

@coindex prop assertion
@glindex prop assertion 
This assertion is similar to a @code{pred/1} assertion but it flags that the predicate being documented is also a ``
@glindex property
property.'' 

Properties are standard predicates, but which are @emph{guaranteed to terminate for any possible instantiation state of their argument(s)}, do not perform side-effects which may interfere with the program behaviour, and do not further instantiate their arguments or add new constraints. 

Provided the above holds, properties can thus be safely used as 
@glindex run-time checks
run-time checks. The program transformation used in @code{ciaopp} for run-time checking guarantees the third requirement. It also performs some basic checks on properties which in most cases are enough for the second requirement. However, it is the user's responsibility to guarantee termination of the properties defined. (See also @ref{Declaring regular types} for some considerations applicable to writing properties.) 

The set of properties is thus a strict subset of the set of predicates. Note that properties can be used to describe characteristics of arguments in assertions and they can also be executed (called) as any other predicates.

This assertion provides information about the @emph{external} calls to a predicate. It is identical syntactically to a

@code{calls/1} assertion. However, they describe only external calls, i.e., calls to the exported predicates of a module from outside the module, or calls to the predicates in a non-modular file from other files (or the user). 

These assertions are @emph{trusted} by the compiler. As a result, if their descriptions are erroneous they can introduce bugs in programs. Thus, 
@glindex entry/1
@code{entry/1} assertions should be written with care. 

An important use of these assertions is in 
@glindex providing information to the compiler
providing information to the compiler which it may not be able to infer from the program. The main use is in providing information on the ways in which exported predicates of a module will be called from outside the module. This will greatly improve the precision of the analyzer, which otherwise has to assume that the arguments that exported predicates receive are any arbitrary term.

This assertion is used to define modes. A mode defines in a compact way a set of call and success properties. Once defined, modes can be applied to predicate arguments in assertions. The meaning of this application is that the call and success properties defined by the mode hold for the argument to which the mode is applied. Thus, a mode is conceptually a ``property macro''. 

The syntax of mode definitions is similar to that of pred declarations. For example, the following set of assertions: 


@smallexample 
:- modedef +A : nonvar(A) # "@code{A} is bound upon predicate entry.".

:- pred p(+A,B) : integer(A) =>  ground(B).

An important use of these assertions is in 
@glindex providing information to the compiler
providing information to the compiler which it may not be able to infer from the program (either because the information is not present or because the analyzer being used is not precise enough). In particular, providing information on external predicates which may not be accessible at the time of compiling the module can greatly improve the precision of the analyzer. This can be easily done with trust assertion.

This module is part of the 
@glindex assertions
@code{assertions} library. It provides the formal definition of the syntax of several forms of assertions and describes their meaning. It does so by defining types and properties related to the assertions themselves. The text describes, for example, the overall fields which are admissible in the bodies of assertions, where properties can be used inside these bodies, how to combine properties for a given predicate argument (e.g., conjunctions) , etc. and provides some examples.

@coindex assertion body syntax
@glindex assertion body syntax 
This predicate defines the different types of syntax admissible in the bodies of 
@glindex pred/1
@code{pred/1}, 
@glindex decl/1
@code{decl/1}, etc. assertions. Such a body is of the form: 


@smallexample 
      Pr [:: DP] [: CP] [=> AP] [+ GP] [# CO]
     @end smallexample  

where (fields between [...] are optional): 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{Pr} is a 
@glindex head pattern
head pattern (
@glindex head_pattern/1
@code{head_pattern/1}) which describes the predicate or property and possibly gives some implicit call/answer information. 


@item @code{DP} is a (possibly empty) 
@glindex complex argument property
complex argument property (
@glindex complex_arg_property/1
@code{complex_arg_property/1}) which expresses properties which are 
@glindex compatible
compatible with the predicate, i.e., instantiations made by the predicate are @emph{compatible} with the properties in the sense that applying the property at any point to would not make it fail. 


@item @code{CP} is a (possibly empty) 
@glindex complex argument property
complex argument property (
@glindex complex_arg_property/1
@code{complex_arg_property/1}) which applies to the @emph{calls} to the predicate. 


@item @code{AP} is a (possibly empty) 
@glindex complex argument property
complex argument property (
@glindex complex_arg_property/1
@code{complex_arg_property/1}) which applies to the @emph{answers} to the predicate (if the predicate succeeds). These only apply if the (possibly empty) properties given for calls in the assertion hold. 


@item @code{GP} is a (possibly empty) 
@glindex complex goal property
complex goal property (
@glindex complex_goal_property/1
@code{complex_goal_property/1}) which applies to the @emph{whole execution} of a call to the predicate. These only apply if the (possibly empty) properties given for calls in the assertion hold. 


@item @code{CO} is a 
@glindex comment string
comment string (
@glindex docstring/1
@code{docstring/1}). This comment only applies if the (possibly empty) properties given for calls in the assertion hold. The usual formatting commands that are applicable in comment strings can be used (see 
@glindex stringcommand/1
@code{stringcommand/1}).

@prindex head_pattern/1 
@glindex head_pattern/1 
@deffn PROPERTY head_pattern/1:



A 
@glindex head pattern
head pattern can be a predicate name (functor/arity) (
@glindex predname/1
@code{predname/1}) or a term. Thus, both @code{p/3} and @code{p(A,B,C)} are valid head patterns. In the case in which the head pattern is a term, each argument of such a term can be: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item A variable. This is useful in order to be able to refer to the corresponding argument positions by name within properties and in comments. Thus, @code{p(Input,Parameter,Output)} is a valid head pattern. 


@item A ground term. In this case this term determines a property of the corresponding argument. The actual property referred to is that given by the term but with one more argument added at the beginning, which is a new variable which, in a rewriting of the head pattern, appears at the argument position occupied by the term. Unless otherwise stated (see below), the property built this way is understood to hold for both calls and answers. For example, the head pattern @code{p(Input,list(integer),Output)} is valid and equivalent for example to having the head pattern @code{p(Input,A,Output)} and stating that the property @code{list(A,integer)} holds for the calls and successes of the predicate. 


@item Finally, it can also be a variable or a ground term, as above, but preceded by a ``
@glindex mode
mode.'' This mode determines in a compact way certain call or answer properties. For example, the head pattern @code{p(Input,+list(integer),Output)} is valid, as long as 
@glindex +/1
@code{+/1} is declared as a mode. 

Acceptable modes 
@coindex acceptable modes
@glindex acceptable modes 
are documented in 
@glindex library(modes)
@code{library(modes)}. User defined modes are documented in 
@glindex modedef/1
@code{modedef/1}.

@code{property_conjunction/1} and

@code{property_starterm/1} respectively. The two formats can be mixed provided they are not in the same field of an assertion. I.e., the following is a valid assertion:

This type defines the first, unabridged format in which properties can be expressed in the bodies of assertions. It is essentially a conjunction of properties which refer to variables. The following is an example of a complex property in this format: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{(integer(X),list(Y,integer))}: @code{X} has the property 
@glindex integer/1
@code{integer/1} and @code{Y} has the property

@deffn REGTYPE property_starterm/1:



This type defines a second, compact format in which properties can be expressed in the bodies of assertions. A 
@glindex property_starterm/1
@code{property_starterm/1} is a term whose main functor is 
@glindex */2
@code{*/2} and, when it appears in an assertion, the number of terms joined by 
@glindex */2
@code{*/2} is exactly the arity of the predicate it refers to. A similar series of properties as in 
@glindex property_conjunction/1
@code{property_conjunction/1} appears, but the arity of each property is one less: the argument position to which they refer (first argument) is left out and determined by the position of the property in the 
@glindex property_starterm/1
@code{property_starterm/1}. The idea is that each element of the 
@glindex */2
@code{*/2} term corresponds to a head argument position. Several properties can be assigned to each argument position by grouping them in curly brackets. The following is an example of a complex property in this format: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{ integer * list(integer)}: the first argument of the procedure (or function, or ...) has the property 
@glindex integer/1
@code{integer/1} and the second one has the property 
@glindex list/2
@code{list/2}, with second argument @code{integer}. 


@item @code{ @{integer,var@} * list(integer)}: the first argument of the procedure (or function, or ...) has the properties 
@glindex integer/1
@code{integer/1} and 
@glindex var/1
@code{var/1} and the second one has the property 
@glindex list/2

This library package adds some new declaration definitions and new operator definitions to user programs. These new declarations and operators provide some very simple syntactic sugar to support 
@glindex regular type definitions
regular type definitions in source code. Regular types are just properties which have the additional characteristic of being 
@glindex regular types
regular types (
@glindex basic_props:regtype/1
@code{basic_props:regtype/1}). 

For example, this library package allows writing: 
@smallexample 
   :- regtype tree(X) # "@code{X} is a tree.".
   @end smallexample  
instead of the more combersome: 
@smallexample 
   :- prop tree(X) + regtype # "@code{X} is a tree.".
   @end smallexample  

Regular types can be used as properties to describe predicates and play an essential role in program debugging (see the Ciao Prolog preprocessor (@code{ciaopp}) manual). 

In this chapter we explain some general considerations worth taking into account when writing properties in general, not just regular types. The exact 
@glindex syntax of regular types
syntax of regular types is also described.

@section Defining properties 

Given the classes of assertions in the Ciao assertion language, there are two fundamental classes of properties. Properties used in assertions which refer to execution states (i.e., @code{calls/1}, @code{success/1}, and the like) are called 
@coindex properties of execution states
@glindex properties of execution states
@emph{properties of execution states}. Properties used in assertions related to computations (i.e., @code{comp/1}) are called 
@coindex properties of computations
@glindex properties of computations
@emph{properties of computations}. Different considerations apply when writing a property of the former or of the later kind. 

Consider a definition of the predicate @code{string_concat/3} which concatenates two character strings (represented as lists of ASCII codes): 
@smallexample 
string_concat([],L,L).
string_concat([X|Xs],L,[X|NL]):- string_concat(Xs,L,NL).
@end smallexample  

Assume that we would like to state in an assertion that each argument ``is a list of integers.'' However, we must decide which one of the following two possibilities we mean exactly: ``the argument is @emph{instantiated} to a list of integers'' (let us call this property @code{instantiated_to_intlist/1}), or ``if any part of the argument is instantiated, this instantiation must be compatible with the argument being a list of integers'' (we will call this property @code{compatible_with_intlist/1}). For example, @code{instantiated_to_intlist/1} should be true for the terms @code{[]} and @code{[1,2]}, but should not for @code{X}, @code{[a,2]}, and @code{[X,2]}. In turn, @code{compatible_with_intlist/1} should be true for @code{[]}, @code{X}, @code{[1,2]}, and @code{[X,2]}, but should not be for @code{[X|1]}, @code{[a,2]}, and @code{1}. We refer to properties such as @code{instantiated_to_intlist/1} above as 
@coindex instantiation properties
@glindex instantiation properties
@emph{instantiation properties} and to those such as @code{compatible_with_intlist/1} as 
@coindex compatibility properties
@glindex compatibility properties
@emph{compatibility properties} (corresponding to the traditional notions of ``instantiation types'' and ``compatibility types''). 

It turns out that both of these notions are quite useful in practice. In the example above, we probably would like to use @code{compatible_with_intlist/1} to state that on success of @code{string_concat/3} all three argument must be compatible with lists of integers in an assertion like: 


@smallexample 
:- success string_concat(A,B,C) => ( compatible_with_intlist(A),
                                     compatible_with_intlist(B),
                                     compatible_with_intlist(C) ).
@end smallexample  

With this assertion, no error will be flagged for a call to @code{string_concat/3} such as @code{string_concat([20],L,R)}, which on success produces the resulting atom @code{string_concat([20],L,[20|L])}, but a call @code{string_concat([],a,R)} would indeed flag an error. 

On the other hand, and assuming that we are running on a Prolog system, we would probably like to use @code{instantiated_to_intlist/1} for @code{sumlist/2} as follows: 


@smallexample 
:- calls sumlist(L,N) : instantiated_to_intlist(L).

sumlist([],0).
sumlist([X|R],S) :- sumlist(R,PS), S is PS+X.
@end smallexample  


@noindent
to describe the type of calls for which the program has been designed, i.e., those in which the first argument of @code{sumlist/2} is indeed a list of integers. 

The property @code{instantiated_to_intlist/1} might be written as in the following (Prolog) definition: 


@smallexample 
:- prop instantiated_to_intlist/1.

instantiated_to_intlist(X) :- 
       nonvar(X), instantiated_to_intlist_aux(X).

instantiated_to_intlist_aux([]).
instantiated_to_intlist_aux([X|T]) :-
       integer(X), instantiated_to_intlist(T).
@end smallexample  

(Recall that the Prolog builtin @code{integer/1} itself implements an instantiation check, failing if called with a variable as the argument.) 

The property @code{compatible_with_intlist/1} might in turn be written as follows (also in Prolog): 


@smallexample 
:- prop compatible_with_intlist/1.

compatible_with_intlist(X) :- var(X).
compatible_with_intlist(X) :- 
       nonvar(X), compatible_with_intlist_aux(X).

compatible_with_intlist_aux([]).
compatible_with_intlist_aux([X|T]) :-
       int_compat(X), compatible_with_intlist(T).

int_compat(X) :- var(X).
int_compat(X) :- nonvar(X), integer(X).
@end smallexample  

Note that these predicates meet the criteria for being properties and thus the @code{prop/1} declaration is correct. 

Ensuring that a property meets the criteria for ``not affecting the computation'' can sometimes make its coding somewhat tedious. In some ways, one would like to be able to write simply: 


@smallexample 
intlist([]).
intlist([X|R]) :- int(X), intlist(R).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
(Incidentally, note that the above definition, provided that it suits the requirements for being a property and that @code{int/1} is a regular type, meets the criteria for being a regular type. Thus, it could be declared @code{:- regtype intlist/1}.) 

But note that (independently of the definition of @code{int/1}) the definition above is not the correct instantiation check, since it would succeed for a call such as @code{intlist(X)}. In fact, it is not strictly correct as a compatibility property either, because, while it would fail or succeed as expected, it would perform instantiations (e.g., if called with @code{intlist(X)} it would bind @code{X} to @code{[]}). In practice, it is convenient to provide some run-time support to aid in this task. 

The run-time support of the Ciao system (see @ref{Run-time checking of assertions}) ensures that the execution of properties is performed in such a way that properties written as above can be used directly as instantiation checks. Thus, writing: 


@smallexample 
:- calls sumlist(L,N) : intlist(L).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
has the desired effect. Also, the same properties can often be used as compatibility checks by writing them in the assertions as @code{compat(Property)} (@code{basic_props:compat/1}). Thus, writing: 


@smallexample 
:- success string_concat(A,B,C) => ( compat(intlist(A)),
                                     compat(intlist(B)),
                                     compat(intlist(C)) ).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
also has the desired effect. 

As a general rule, the properties that can be used directly for checking for compatibility should be @emph{downwards closed}, i.e., once they hold they will keep on holding in every state accessible in forwards execution. There are certain predicates which are inherently @emph{instantiation} checks and should not be used as @emph{compatibility} properties nor appear in the definition of a property that is to be used with @code{compat}. Examples of such predicates (for Prolog) are @code{==}, @code{ground}, @code{nonvar}, @code{integer}, @code{atom}, @code{>}, etc. as they require a certain instantiation degree of their arguments in order to succeed. 

In contrast with properties of execution states, @emph{properties of computations} refer to the entire execution of the call(s) that the assertion relates to. One such property is, for example, @code{not_fail/1} (note that although it has been used as in @code{:- comp append(Xs,Ys,Zs) + not_fail}, it is in fact read as @code{not_fail(append(Xs,Ys,Zs))}; see @code{assertions_props:complex_goal_property/1}). For this property, which should be interpreted as ``execution of the predicate either succeeds at least once or loops,'' we can use the following predicate @code{not_fail/1} for run-time checking: 


@smallexample 
not_fail(Goal):-
      if( call(Goal),
          true,            %% then
          warning(Goal) ). %% else
@end smallexample  


@noindent
where the @code{warning/1} (library) predicate simply prints a warning message. 

In this simple case, implementation of the predicate is not very difficult using the (non-standard) @code{if/3} builtin predicate present in many Prolog systems. 



However, it is not so easy to code predicates which check other properties of the computation and we may in general need to program a meta-interpreter for this purpose.

@coindex regtype assertion
@glindex regtype assertion 
This assertion is similar to a pred assertion but it flags that the predicate being documented is also a ``
@glindex regular type
regular type.'' This allows for example checking whether it is in the class of types supported by the type checking and inference modules. Currently, types are properties whose definitions are @emph{regular programs}. 

 A regular program is defined by a set of clauses, each of the form: 
@smallexample 
p(x, v_1, ..., v_n)  :- body_1, ..., body_k.
@end smallexample  
where: 
@enumerate  
@item @code{x} is a term whose variables (which are called @emph{term variables}) are unique, i.e., it is not allowed to introduce equality constraints between the variables of @code{x}. 

For example, @code{p(f(X, Y)) :- ...} is valid, but @code{p(f(X, X)) :- ...} is not. 


@item in all clauses defining @code{p/n+1} the terms @code{x} do not unify except maybe for one single clause in which @code{x} is a variable. 


@item @code{n} >= 0 and @code{p/n} is a 
@coindex parametric type functor
@glindex parametric type functor
@emph{parametric type functor} (whereas the predicate defined by the clauses is @code{p/n}+1). 


@item @code{v_1}, ..., @code{v_n} are unique variables, which are called @emph{parametric variables}. 


@item Each @code{body_i} is of the form: 


@enumerate  
@item @code{t(z)} where @code{z} is one of the @emph{term variables} and @code{t} is a @emph{regular type expression}; 


@item @code{q(y, t_1, ..., t_m)} where @code{m} >= 0, @code{q/m} is a @emph{parametric type functor}, not in the set of functors @code{=/2}, @code{^/2}, @code{./3}. 

@code{t_1, ..., t_m} are @emph{regular type expressions}, and @code{y} is a @emph{term variable}. 
@end enumerate  


@item Each term variable occurs at most once in the clause's body (and should be as the first argument of a literal). 
@end enumerate  
A 
@coindex regular type expression
@glindex regular type expression
@emph{regular type expression} is either a parametric variable or a parametric type functor applied to some of the parametric variables (but 
@glindex regular type abstractions
regular type abstractions might also be used in some cases, see @ref{Meta-properties}). 

A parametric type functor is a regular type, defined by a regular program, or a basic type. Basic types are defined in @ref{Basic data types and properties}. 







The set of types is thus a well defined subset of the set of properties. Note that types can be used to describe characteristics of arguments in assertions and they can also be executed (called) as any other predicates.

This file defines a number of very simple ``
@glindex modes
modes'' which are frequently useful in programs. These correspond to the modes used in classical Prolog texts with some simple addtions. Note that some of these modes use the same symbol as one of the ISO-modes (see @ref{ISO-Prolog modes}) but with subtly different meaning.

This library package allows the use of run-time checks for the assertions introduced in a program. 

The recommended way of performing 
@coindex run-time checks
@glindex run-time checks
@emph{run-time checks} of predicate assertions in a program is via the Ciao preprocessor (see @code{ciaopp} manual), which performs the required program transformation. However, this package can also be used to perform checking of program-point assertions.

This library allows the redefinition of the files to which the special streams @code{user_input}, @code{user_output}, and @code{user_error} point to. On startup they point to the standard input, standard output, and standard error, in Unix style (Windows users may find that standard error stream does not work properly). Changing the file pointed to is useful for, e.g., redirecting the place to which the Prolog's standard error stream goes from within Prolog (e.g., to start a log file).

This predicate may be used in two ways: 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item To create a file name from its components: name and extension. For instance:

File = 'mywork.txt' ? 

yes
?- 
@end smallexample  


@item To split a file name into its name and extension. For Instance:

A = mywork,
B = '.txt' ? 

yes

This module provides a predicate for file opening which can use any term as an alias for the filename (i.e., symbolic filenames) instead of the usual constants which are file system path names of the actual files. 

The correspondence between an alias and the actual file path is done dynamically, without having to recompile the program. It is possible to define the correspondence via facts for 
@glindex file_alias/2
@code{file_alias/2} in a file declared with 
@glindex multifile:alias_file/1
@code{multifile:alias_file/1} in the program: those facts will be dynamically loaded when running the program. Alternatively, the correspondence can be defined via shell environment variables, by defining the value of a variable by the (symbolic) name of the file to be the path of the actual file.

@section Other information (@code{symfnames})

 The example discussed here is included in the distribution files. There is a main application file which uses module @code{mm}. This module reads a line from a file; the main predicate in the main file then prints this line. The important thing is that the file read is named by a symbolic name "@code{file}". The main application file declares another file where the symbolic names are assigned actual file names: 


@smallexample 

:- use_module(mm).

:- multifile alias_file/1.
alias_file(myfiles).

main :- p(X), display(X), nl.

@end smallexample  

Now, the file @code{myfiles.pl} can be used to change the file you want to read from without having to recompile the application. The current assignment is: 


@smallexample 

%:- use_package([]).
file_alias(file,'mm.pl').

@end smallexample  


@noindent
so the execution of the application will show the first line of @code{mm.pl}. However, you can change to: 


@smallexample 
file_alias(file,'main.pl').

@end smallexample  


@noindent
and then execution of the same executable will show the first line of @code{main.pl}.

Currently, @code{ask/2} and @code{instance/2} are exactly the same. However, @code{ask/2} is more general, since it is also applicable to constraint domains (although not yet implemented): for the particular case of Herbrand terms, it is just @code{instance/2} (which is the only ask check currently implemented).

@glindex librowser
@code{librowser} library provides a set of predicates wich enables the user to interactively find Ciao/Prolog libraries and/or any predicate exported by them. 

This is a simple example: 


@smallexample 
?- apropos('*find*').
persdbrt_sql: dbfindall/4
persdbrtsql: dbfindall/4
conc_aggregates: findall/3
linda: rd_findall/3
vndict: find_name/4
internals: $find_file/8
aggregates: findall/4,findall/3

yes
?-
@end smallexample  

Librowser is specially usefull when using inside GNU Emacs, just place the cursor over a librowser response and press C-cTAB in order to get help on the related predicate. Refer to the @strong{"Using Ciao inside GNU Emacs"} chapter for further information.

@item @strong{Library usage:}

It is not necesary to use this library at user programs. It was designed to be used at the Ciao @emph{toplevel} shell: 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}. In order to do so, just make use of 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1} as follows: 

@code{use_module(library(librowser))}. 

Then, the library interface must be read. This is automatically done when calling any predicate at librowser, and the entire process will take a little moment.So, you should want to perform such a process after loading the Ciao toplevel: 


@smallexample 
Ciao 0.9 #75: Fri Apr 30 19:04:24 MEST 1999
?- use_module(library(librowser)).

yes
?- update.

@end smallexample  

Whether you want this process to be automatically performed when loading 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}, you may include those lines in your @emph{.ciaorc} personal initialization file.

This library offers a general way to perform clause body expansions. Goal, fact and spec translation predicates are authomatically called when needed, while this utility navigates through the meta-argument specification of the body itself. All predicates within this library must be called at @emph{second-pass expansions}, since it uses information stored at 
@glindex c_itf
@code{c_itf} library.

This module provides basic mechanisms for using concurrency and implementing multi-goal applications.
@coindex concurrency
@glindex concurrency 
It provides a means for arbitrary goals to be specified to be run in a separate stack set; in that case, they are assigned a goal identifier with which further accesses (e.g., asking for more solutions) to the goal can be made. Additionally, in some architectures, these goals can be assigned an O.S. thread, separate from the one which made the initial call, thus providing concurrency and, in multiprocessors, parallelism capabilities. 

As for now, the memory space of the threads (c.f., stack sets) is separate in the sense that goals are copied to the new stack set, and bindings of variables are not seen among stack sets which allows forward and backward execution to proceed independently in each stack set, at the cost of the initial goal copy. However, the program space (including, specially, the 
@glindex concurrent predicates
concurrent predicates) are shared and seen by all the goals and threads, and should be used as the primary means of communication and synchronization. Higer level libraries can be built using these basic blocks. 

Additionally, a small set of lock primitives are provided. Locks are associated with atom names. Whereas the concurrent database facilities are enough to implement locks, semaphores, messages, etc., the predicates implementing atom-based locks are faster than the ones accessing the concurrent database (but they are less powerful).

@code{concurrent F/A}


The predicate named @code{F} with arity @code{A} is made 
@glindex concurrent
concurrent in the current module at runtime (useful for predicate names generated on-the-fly). This difficults a better compile-time analysis, but in turn offers more flexibility to applications. It is also faster for some applications: if several agents have to share data in a stuctured fashion (e.g., the generator knows and wants to restrict the data generated to a set of other threads), a possibility is to use the same concurrent fact and emply a field within the fact to distinguish the receiver/sender. This can cause many threads to access and wait on the same fact, which in turns can create contention problems. It is much better to create a new concurrent fact and to use that new name as a channel to communicate the different threads. 
@glindex concurrent/1
@code{concurrent/1} can either be given a 
@glindex predicate spec
predicate spec in the form @code{Name/Arity}, with @code{Name} and @code{Arity} bound, or to give a value only to @code{Arity}, and let the system choose a new, unused @code{Name} for the fact.

@item
Available only for Windows 32 environments and for architectures implementing POSIX threads.

@item
Some implementation of threads have a limit on the total number of threads that can be created by a process. Thread creation, in this case, just hangs. A better solution is planned for the future.

@item
Creating many concurrent facts may fill up the atom table, causing Ciao Prolog to abort.

@strong{Author(s):} Concurrent-safe (and incomplete) version of the aggregates predicates, based on the regular versions by Richard A. O'Keefe and David H.D. Warren. Concurrency-safeness provided by Manuel Carro..

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#221 (2003/12/21, 20:6:33 CET)

This module implements thread-safe aggregation predicates. Its use and results should be the same as those in the 
@glindex aggregates
aggregates library, but several goals can use them concurrently without the interference and wrong results (due to implementation reasons) 
@glindex aggregates
aggregates might lead to. This particular implementation is completely based on the one used in the 
@glindex aggregates
aggregates library.

This module defines primitives to open sockets, send, and receive data from them. This allows communicating with other processes, on the same machine or across the Internet. The reader should also consult standard bibliography on the topic for a proper use of these primitives.

@subsection The Dependency Rules 


@noindent
The package allows defining the following types of rules: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{@emph{TargetSuffix} <= @emph{SourceSuffix} :: @emph{SourceRoot} :- @emph{BodyLiterals}.} 

A rule of this form declares that in order to produce the file with suffix @emph{TargetSuffix} from a source file with the suffix @emph{SourceSuffix} and root name @emph{SourceRoot} the commands in @emph{BodyLiterals} must be executed. @emph{BodyLiterals} is a standard Ciao Prolog clause body, i.e., a comma-separated conjunction of literals. When writing the script, @emph{SourceRoot} is typically left as a variable, to be instantiated by 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} when the script is run to the root of name of the file to be processed. This allows using the value of @emph{SourceRoot} in @emph{BodyLiterals}. For example, the following rule: 


@smallexample 
:- use_module(library(terms),[atom_concat/2]).

dvi <= tex :: FileRoot :-
        atom_concat(['latex ',FileRoot,'.tex'],Command),
        system(Command).
@end smallexample  

states that we can generate a file @emph{File}@code{.dvi} if we have a file named @emph{File}@code{.tex} and that the command to do so is @code{latex }@emph{File}@code{.tex}. Thus, if this rule appears in file 
@glindex Makefile.pl
@code{Makefile.pl} and we issue the command @code{lpmake paper.dvi} the following occurs: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If @code{paper.dvi} does not exist and @code{paper.tex} exists, then @code{paper.dvi} is generated from @code{paper.tex} by issuing the system command @code{latex paper.tex}. 


@item If @code{paper.dvi} already exists, nothing is done. 


@item If @code{paper.tex} does not exist, an error is reported. 


@end itemize  


@item @code{@emph{Target} <- :- @emph{BodyLiterals}.} 

A rule of this form declares that in order to produce the file @emph{Target} the commands in @emph{BodyLiterals} must be executed. @emph{Target} need not be a real file: it can also be simply the name of the rule, which is used to invoke it (as a procedure name). For example, the following rule, when the command @code{lpmake realclean} is issued, deletes temporary files in the LaTeX application: 


@smallexample 
:- use_module(library('make/system_extra')).

clean <- :-
        ls('*aux|*log|*~',Files)
        delete_files(Files).
@end smallexample  


@item @code{@emph{Target} <- @emph{Deps} :- @emph{BodyLiterals}.} 

A rule of this form declares that in order to produce the file @emph{Target}, first targets @emph{Deps} will be called (i.e., the elements of @emph{Deps} are either other targets with rules defined for them, or a file or files which are already present or which can --and will be-- generated from other available files using other rules). Then, the commands in @emph{BodyLiterals} will be executed. @emph{Deps} may be one target or a list of targets. For example, the following rule, when the command @code{lpmake realclean} is issued, cleans all the temporary files in the LaTeX application (including @code{.dvi} and @code{.ps} files). It requires that clean be executed first: 


@smallexample 
:- use_package(functions).
:- use_module(library('make/system_extra')).

realclean <- clean :-
        delete_files(~ls('*dvi|*ps')).
@end smallexample  

The following rule states that in order to meet the target @code{view}, target @code{paper.ps} must be available or generated. For example, @code{lpmake view} can be used to call the 
@glindex ghostview
@code{ghostview} visualizer on @code{paper.ps}. Note the use of a globally defined @emph{predicate} @code{main} which is called in two places in the rule, and could be used in other rules in the same file (@code{main := paper.} is equivalent to the fact @code{main(paper).} --see the 
@glindex functions
@code{functions} library): 


@smallexample 
:- use_package(functions).
:- use_module(library('make/system_extra')).
:- use_module(library(terms),[atom_concat/2]).

main := paper.

view <- ~atom_concat([~main,'.ps']) :-
        system(~atom_concat(['ghostview ',~main,'.ps'])).
@end smallexample  


@end table  

In addition to these rules, the configuration file can define normal predicates in the usual way, or import predicates from other modules, all of which can be called from the bodies of the dependency rules. For example, the 
@glindex system_extra
@code{system_extra} library (an extension of the 
@glindex system
@code{system} library) defines many system predicates in a form which makes them very useful inside 
@glindex Makefile
@code{Makefile}s, specially if the 
@glindex functions
@code{functions} package is used (see the examples below). 

If 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} is called without an explicit target as argument, then the first target rule in the Makefile is used. This is useful in that the first rule can be seen as the default rule. 



@node Specifying Paths, Documenting Rules, The Dependency Rules, Other information (make)
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Specifying Paths 

Using the 
@glindex vpath/1
@code{vpath/1} predicate it is possible in configuration files to define several paths in which files related to the rules can be located. In this way, not all files need to be in the same directory as the configuration file. For example: 


@smallexample 
:- use_package(functions).

vpath := '/home/clip/Systems/ciao/lib'.
vpath := '/home/clip/Systems/ciao/library'.
vpath := '/home/clip/Systems/lpdoc/lib'.
@end smallexample  



@node Documenting Rules, An Example of a Makefile, Specifying Paths, Other information (make)
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@subsection Documenting Rules 


@noindent
It is also possible to define documentation for the rules: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{target_comment(@emph{Target}) :- @emph{BodyLiterals}.} 

A rule of this form allows documenting the actions related to the target. The body (@emph{BodyLiterals}) will be called in two circumstances: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If @emph{Target} is called during execution of '@code{lpmake} @emph{commands}'. 


@item When calling '@code{lpmake -h}'. 


@end itemize  

Using noun forms (@emph{generation of foo} instead of @emph{generating foo}) in comments helps this dual purpose. For example, the following rule: 


@smallexample 
target_comment(realclean) :- 
        display('Cleanup of all generated files.').
@end smallexample  

will produce output in the two cases pointed out above. 


@item @code{dependency_comment(@emph{SourceSuffix},@emph{TargetSuffix},@emph{SourceRoot}) :- @emph{BodyLiterals}.} 

Same as the previous rule, but for suffix rules. See, for example, the following generic rule: 


@smallexample 
:- use_module(library(terms),[atom_concat/2]).

dependency_comment(SSuffix,TSuffix,FileBase) :- 
        display(~atom_concat(['Generation of ',FileBase,'.',TSuffix,
                              ' from ',FileBase,'.',SSuffix])).
@end smallexample  


@end table

@subsection An Example of a Makefile 

The following is a simple example of a Makefile showing some basic functionality (this is @code{MakefileExample.pl} in the @code{example_simple} directory in the 
@glindex make
@code{make} library.): 


@smallexample 
%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- module(_,_,[make,functions]).
:- use_module(library('make/system_extra')).
:- use_module(library(lists),[append/3,list_concat/2]).
:- use_module(library(terms),[atom_concat/2]).

:- discontiguous(comment/2).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% A simple target. Defines how to produce file 'hw'.

hw <-  []    :-
         writef("Hello world", hw).

%% A comment describing this target (see below):
comment(hw,['Generation of file hw']).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% A target with a dependency. 'hwhw' requires 'hw'.

hwhw <- [hw] :-
        readf(hw,Content),
        append(Content,[0'\n|Content],DoubleContent),
        writef(DoubleContent,hwhw).

comment(hwhw,['Generation of file hwhw']).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% A simple target. Defines how to produce file 'datafile.simple'.

'datafile.simple' <-  :-
        writef("Hello world", 'datafile.simple').

comment('datafile.simple',['Generation of file datafile.simple']).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% A dependency based on suffixes: 
%% <file>.double is generated always from <file>.simple

double <= simple :: Name :-
        readf(~atom_concat([Name,'.simple']),Content),
        append(Content,[0'\n|Content],DoubleContent),
        writef(DoubleContent,~atom_concat([Name,'.double'])).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% A dependency based on suffixes with a precondition.
%% <file>.double is generated always from <file>.simple, once precond is done

boo <- :-
        display((double <= simple :: name <- precond :- body1, body2)).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Example using library predicates

clean <-    :-
        delete_files(~ls('*~|*.asr|*.itf|*.po')).

comment(clean,['Cleanup of temporary files']).

realclean <- clean :-
        delete_files(~ls('hw|hwhw|*simple|*double')).

comment(realclean,['Cleanup of all generated files']).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Reporting progress and documenting commands: 
%% If target_comment/1 is defined it can be used to produce user-defined 
%% output when targets are processed and/or documentation on what each 
%% target does (used for example when lpmake is called with -h). Using 
%% 'generation of foo' instead of 'generating foo' in comments helps in this 
%% dual purpose.
%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

%% Make calls target_comment/1 for simple targets:
target_comment(Target) :- 
        comment(Target,Comment),
        display(~atom_concat([~atom_concat(Comment), '\n'])).

%% Similarly, make calls dependency_comment/3 for dependencies (only 
%% during execution, not when documenting -h).
dependency_comment(SSuffix,TSuffix,FileBase) :- 
        display(~atom_concat(['Generation of ',FileBase,'.',TSuffix,
                              ' from ',FileBase,'.',SSuffix])).

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are a few commands that can be used on the previous file (see file @code{CommandsToTry} in the @code{example_simple} directory in the 
@glindex make
@code{make} library): 


@smallexample 

lpmake -m MakefileExample.pl hwhw

lpmake -m MakefileExample.pl datafile.double
(Generate file datafile.double --needs to generate file datafile.simple first)

lpmake -m MakefileExample.pl realclean
(Cleanup)

lpmake -h -m MakefileExample.pl
(Help on general use of lpmake and commands available in MakefileExample.pl)

This is a (temporary) extension to library 
@glindex system
@code{system} (which it reexports). It implements functionality that is often convenient in 
@glindex Makefile
@code{Makefile}s. Much of this should probably end up eventually in 
@glindex system
@code{system}, but once we have worked out the best interface and, in some cases, the proper implementation (the implementations in here are in some cases just calls to Un*x shell primitives or commands).

This library package allows the use of 
@coindex pure Prolog
@glindex pure Prolog
@emph{pure Prolog} in a Ciao module/program. It is based on the fact that if an 
@coindex engine module
@glindex engine module
@emph{engine module} is imported explicitly then all of them have to be imported explicitly. The engine modules are: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item @code{engine(arithmetic)} 

@ref{Arithmetic}. 
@item @code{engine(atomic_basic)} 

@ref{Basic predicates handling names of constants}. 
@item @code{engine(attributes)} 

@ref{Attributed variables}. 
@item @code{engine(basic_props)} 

@ref{Basic data types and properties}. 
@item @code{engine(basiccontrol)} 

@ref{Control constructs/predicates}. 
@item @code{engine(data_facts)} 

@ref{Fast/concurrent update of facts}. 
@item @code{engine(exceptions)} 

@ref{Exception handling}. 
@item @code{engine(io_aux)} 

@ref{Message printing primitives}. 
@item @code{engine(io_basic)} 

@ref{Basic input/output}. 
@item @code{engine(prolog_flags)} 

@ref{Changing system behaviour and various flags}. 
@item @code{engine(streams_basic)} 

@ref{Basic file/stream handling}. 
@item @code{engine(system_info)} 

@ref{Gathering some basic internal info}. 
@item @code{engine(term_basic)} 

@ref{Basic term manipulation}. 
@item @code{engine(term_compare)} 

@ref{Comparing terms}. 
@item @code{engine(term_typing)} 

@ref{Extra-logical properties for typing}. 
@end itemize  

Note that if any of these modules is explicitely imported in a program then the language defaults to Pure Prolog, plus the functionality added by the modules explicitely imported. 

It is recommended that if you explicitely import an engine module you also use this package, which will guarantee that the predicate @code{true/0} is defined (note that this is the only Ciao builtin which cannot be redefined).

This package is an extension of the idea of Prolog indexing, usually performed, in a limited way, on the first argument. This package provides more powerful indexing schemes. It lets you pick different arguments to index on, and provides for different combinations of arguments to index on. E.g., it will let you index on the first and third argument or the second and the third argument of a predicate.

@itemize @minus
@item @emph{Description:} Declares an indexing scheme for a predicate. All specs of @code{IndexSpecs} must be terms for the same predicate. Each spec declares an indexing on a combination of the arguments. Indexing will be performed using any of the specs in @code{IndexSpecs} (being thus interpreted as an or). 

You should use a @code{*} in an argument position if you wish to hash on the entire term in that argument. If a @code{+} is used only one level of the term in the argument is used for hashing. An @code{i} is used to indicate that argument is already an integer, and therefore its own value will be used for hashing. The argspec @code{?} simply indicates not to use the argument for indexing. 

For example, the index specification: 
@smallexample 
:- index foo(+,?,*,i), foo(?,?,?,i).
@end smallexample  
declares indexing for @code{foo/4} either on a combination of the first, third, and fourht arguments, or only on the last argument, which is an integer. In the first case, only the principal functor of the first argument will be used for hashing; the third argument will be used in its entirety. 

The argspec @code{n} is a pragmatic extension and can not be used in conjunction with the other specifiers aside from @code{?}. It stands for "nonvar" and implies that the argument will not be used for hashing, since only ground terms can effectively be used in hashing. Thus, it can not be used in combination with other specifiers within a particular index specification. It is often the fastest thing to use.

@strong{Usage:} :- @code{argnames(ArgNamedPredSpec)}.
@itemize @minus
@item @emph{Description:} An 
@glindex argnames/1
@code{argnames/1} declaration assigns names to the argument positions of terms (or literal/goals) which use a certain functor/arity. This allows referring to these arguments by their name rather than by their argument position. Sometimes, argument names may be clearer and easier to remember than argument positions, specially for predicates with many arguments. Also, in some cases this may allow adding arguments to certain predicates without having to change the code that uses them. These terms with named arguments are sometimes also referred to as 
@glindex records
records, and are also similar to 
@glindex feature terms
feature terms [AKPS92]. For example, in order to write a program for the @emph{zebra} puzzle we might declare: 


@noindent

@smallexample 
:- use_package([argnames]).
:- argnames house(color, nation, pet, drink, car).
@end smallexample  


@noindent
which first includes the package and then assigns a name to each of the arguments of any term (or literal/goal) with @code{house/5} as the main functor. 

For convenience the package extends the built-in 
@glindex data/1
@code{data/1} declaration so that names to arguments can be asigned as with the 
@glindex argnames/1
@code{argnames/1} declaration, as for example: 


@noindent

@smallexample 
:- data product(id, description, brand, quantity).
@end smallexample  

Once an 
@glindex argnames/1
@code{argnames/1} is given, is possible to use the names to refer to the arguments of any term (or literal/goal) which has the same main functor as that of the term which appears in the 
@glindex argnames/1
@code{argnames/1} declaration. This is done by first writing the functor name, then the infix operator @code{$}, and then, between curly brackets, zero, one, or more pairs @emph{argument-name}@code{=>}@emph{argument-value}, separated by commas (i.e., the infix operator @code{=>} is used between the name and the value). Again, argument names must be atomic. Argument values can be any term. Arguments which are not specified are assumed to have a value of ``@code{_}'' (i.e., they are left unconstrained). 

Thus, after the declaration for @code{house/5} in the example above, any ocurrence in that code of, for example, @code{house$@{nation=>Owns_zebra,pet=>zebra@}} is exactly equivalent to @code{house(_,Owns_zebra,zebra,_,_)}. Also, @code{house$@{@}} is equivalent to @code{house(_,_,_,_,_)}. The actual zebra puzzle specification might include a clause such as: 


@noindent

@smallexample 
zebra(Owns_zebra, Drinks_water, Street) :-
   Street = [house$@{@},house$@{@},house$@{@},house$@{@},house$@{@}],
   member(house$@{nation=>Owns_zebra,pet=>zebra@}, Street),
   member(house$@{nation=>Drinks_water,drink=>water@}, Street),
   member(house$@{drink=>coffee,color=>green@}, Street),
   left_right(house$@{color=>ivory@}, house$@{color=>green@}, Street),
   member(house$@{car=>porsche,pet=>snails@}, Street),
        ...
@end smallexample  

Another syntax supported, useful mainly in declarations, to avoid specify the arity is @code{house$@{/@}}, which is equivalent in our example to @code{house/5} (but for data declarations there is a special syntax as we have seen). 

Any number of 
@glindex argnames/1
@code{argnames/1} declarations can appear in a file, one for each functor whose arguments are to be accessed by name. As with other packages, argument name declarations are @emph{local to the file} in which they appear. The 
@glindex argnames/1
@code{argnames/1} declarations affect only program text which appears after the declaration. It is easy to make a set of declarations affect several files for example by putting such declarations in a sepatate file which is included by all such files. 

An 
@glindex argnames/1
@code{argnames/1} declaration does not change in any way the internal representation of the associated terms and does not affect run-time efficiency. It is simply syntactic sugar.

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#291 (2004/2/13, 20:46:8 CET)

This library package allows the use of functional notation in a Ciao module/program. 

It should be made clear that this package just provides a kind of syntactic sugar for defining and using predicates as if they were functions, and thus any function definition is in fact defining a predicate, and any predicate can be used as a function. The predicate associated to a function has the same name and one more argument, added to the right, to hold the result of the function. 

Any term preceded by the operator @code{~} is a function application, as in @code{write(~arg(1,T))}, which is equivalent to the sequence @code{arg(1,T,A), write(A)}. Functors can be declared as evaluable by using the declaration 
@glindex function/1
@code{function/1}, and thus avoiding the need to use the operator @code{~}, as in 
@smallexample 
:- function(arg/2).
@end smallexample  
Note that this declaration, as is customary in Ciao Prolog, is local to the source code where it is included. In addition, the package defines several functors as evaluable by default, those being: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item All the functors understood by 
@glindex is/2
@code{is/2}. This feature can be disabled by a declaration @code{:- function(arith(false))} (and reverted by using @code{true} instead of @code{false}). 
@item The functors used for disjunctive and conditional expressions, @code{(|)/2} and @code{(?)/2}. A disjunctive expression has the form @code{(V1|V2)}, and its value when first evaluated is @code{V1}, and on re-execution @code{V2}. A conditional expression has the form @code{(Cond ? V1)}, or more commonly @code{(Cond ? V1 | V2)}, and its value, if the execution of @code{Cond} as a goal succeeds, is @code{V1}, otherwise in the first form it causes backtracking, and on the second form its value is @code{V2}. Note that due to the operator precedences, these expressions need normally to be surrounded by parenthesis. 
@end itemize  

A functional clause is written using the binary operator @code{:=}, as in 
@smallexample 
opposite(red) := green.
@end smallexample  
Functional clauses can also have a body, which is executed before the result value is computed. It can serve as a guard for the clause or to provide the equivalent of a where-clause in a functional language: 
@smallexample 
fact(0) := 1.
fact(N) := N * ~fact(--N) :- N > 0.
@end smallexample  
Note that often a guard can be better defined using a conditional expression: 
@smallexample 
fact(N) := N = 0 ? 1
         | N > 0 ? N * ~fact(--N).
@end smallexample  

In clause heads (either defined as predicates or functions) functors can be prevented from being evaluated by using the @code{(^)/1} prefix operator, as in 
@smallexample 
pair(A,B) := ^(A-B).
@end smallexample  
Note that this just prevents the evaluation of the principal functor of the enclosed term, not the possible occurrences of other evaluable functors inside. The operator is by now ignored outside clause heads, due to the recurrent nature of the goal translations used. 

When using function applications inside the goal arguments of meta-predicates, there is an ambiguity as they could be evaluated either in the scope of the outer execution or the in the scope of the inner execution. The chosen behavior is by default to evaluate function applications in the scope of the outer execution, and if they should be evaluated in the inner scope, the goal containing the function application needs to be escaped with the @code{(^^)/1} prefix operator, as in @code{findall(X, (d(Y), ^^(X = Y+1)), L)} (which could also be written as @code{findall(X, ^^ (d(Y), X = Y+1), L)}).

@strong{Note:} This is just a partial first shot. The real library still needs to be written. Not difficult, just no time... 

This library will eventually allow and-parallel execution of goals in (Herbrand-)independent fashion. It resembles the execution rules of &-Prolog [HG90]. Basically, goals are run in and-parallel @emph{provided that their arguments do not share bindings}, i.e., are not bound to terms which contain a common variable.

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

This package allows the execution under the Basic Andorra Model [War88]. The model classifies goals as a 
@coindex determinate goal
@glindex determinate goal
@emph{determinate goal}, if at most one clause matches the goal, or nondeterminate goal, otherwise. In this model a goal is delayed until either it becomes determinate or it becomes the leftmost goal and no determinate goal is available. The implementation of this selection rule is based on the use of attributed variables [Hol92,Hol90]. 

In order to test determinacy we verify only the heads of clauses and builtins in the bodies of clauses before the first cut, if any. By default, determinacy of a goal is detected dynamically: when called, if at most one clause matches, it is executed; otherwise, it is delayed. For goals delayed the test is repeated each time a variable appearing in the goal is instantiated. In addition, efficiency can be improved by using declarations that specify the determinacy conditions. These will be considered for testing instead of the generic test on all clauses that can match. 

As with any other Ciao package, the andorra computation rule affects only the module that uses the package. If execution passes across two modules that use the computation rule, determinate goals are run in advance @emph{within} one module and also within the other module. But determinate goals of one module do not run ahead of goals of the other module. 

It is however possible to preserve the computation rule for calls to predicates defined in other modules. These modules should obviously also use this package. In addition @emph{all} predicates from such modules should imported, i.e., the directive @code{:- use_module(module)}, should be used in this case instead of @code{:- use_module(module,[...])}. Otherwise calls to predicates outside the module will only be called when they became the leftmost goal.

Declares determinacy conditions for a predicate. Conditions @code{Cond} are on variables of arguments of @code{Pred}. For example, in:

member(A,[A|B],B).
member(A,[B|C],[B|D]) :-
        A==B,
        member(A,C,D).
@end smallexample  
the declaration states that a call @code{member(A,B,C)} is determinate when either @code{A} doesn't unify with the first argument of @code{B} or @code{C} doesn't unify with @code{[_|_]}.

@item @code{ground/1} and @code{nonvar/1} have the usual meaning. 
@item @code{instatiated(A,Path)} means that the subterm of @code{A} addressed by @code{Path} is not a variable. @code{Path} is a list of integer numbers describing a path to the subterm regarding the whole term A as a tree. For example, @code{instantiated(f(g(X),h(i(Z),Y)),[2,1])} tests whether @code{i(Z)} is not a variable. 
@item @code{Term1 ?\= Term2} means ``terms @code{Term1} and @code{Term2} do not unify (when instantiated)''. @code{Term1} and @code{Term2} can be either an argument of the predicate or a term @code{term(V,Path)}, which refers to the subterm of @code{V} addressed by @code{Path}. 
@item @code{Term1 ?= Term2} means ``terms @code{Term1} and @code{Term2} unify (when instantiated)''. The same considerations above apply to @code{Term1} and @code{Term2}.

@glindex when/2
@code{when/2} delays a predicate until some condition in its variable is met. For example, we may want to find out the maximum of two numbers, but we are not sure when they will be instantiated. We can write the standard 
@glindex max/3
@code{max/3} predicate (but changing its name to 
@glindex gmax/3
@code{gmax/3} to denote that the first and second arguments must be ground) as 


@smallexample 
gmax(X, Y, X):- X > Y, !.
gmax(X, Y, Y):- X =< Y.
@end smallexample  

and then define a 'safe' 
@glindex max/3
@code{max/3} as 
 
@smallexample 
max(X, Y, Z):-
        when((ground(X),ground(Y)), gmax(X, Y, Z)).
@end smallexample  

which can be called as follows: 


@smallexample 
?- max(X, Y, Z) , Y = 0, X = 8.

X = 8,
Y = 0,
Z = 8 ? 

yes
@end smallexample  

Alternatively, 
@glindex max/3
@code{max/3} could have been defined as 


@smallexample 
max(X, Y, Z):-
        when(ground((X, Y)), gmax(X, Y, Z)).
@end smallexample  

with the same effects as above. More complex implementations are possible. Look, for example, at the @code{max.pl} implementation under the @code{when} library directory, where a 
@glindex max/3
@code{max/3} predicate is implemented which waits on all the arguments until there is enough information to determine their values: 


@smallexample 
?- use_module(library('when/max')).

yes
?- max(X, Y, Z), Z = 5, Y = 4.

X = 5,
Y = 4,
Z = 5 ? 

yes

Active modules [CH95] provide a high-level model of 
@glindex inter-process communication
inter-process communication and 
@glindex distributed execution
distributed execution (note that this is also possible using Ciao's communication and concurrency primitives, such as sockets, concurrent predicates, etc., but at a lower level of abstraction). An 
@coindex active module
@glindex active module
@emph{active module} (or an 
@coindex active object
@glindex active object
@emph{active object}) is an ordinary module to which computational resources are attached, and which resides at a given location on the network. Compiling an active module produces an executable which, when running, acts as a @emph{server} for a number of predicates: the predicates exported by the module. Predicates exported by an active module can be accessed by a program on the network by simply ``using'' the module, which then imports such ``remote predicates.'' The process of ``using'' an active module does not involve transferring any code, but rather setting up things so that calls in the module using the active module are executed as remote procedure calls to the active module. This occurs in the same way independently of whether the active module and the using module are in the same machine or in different machines across the network. 

Except for having to compile it in a special way (see below), an active module is identical from the programmer point of view to an ordinary module. A program using an active module imports it and uses it in the same way as any other module, except that it uses ``
@glindex use_active_module
@code{use_active_module}'' rather than ``
@glindex use_module
@code{use_module}'' (see below). Also, an active module has an address (network address) which must be known in order to use it. In order to use an active module it is necessary to know its address: different ``protocols'' are provided for this purpose (see below). 

@footnote{It is also possible to provide active modules via a WWW address. However, we find it more straightforward to simply use socket addresses. In any case, this is generally hidden inside the access method and can be thus made transparent to the user.} 

From the implementation point of view, active modules are essentially daemons: executables which are started as independent processes at the operating system level. Communication with active modules is implemented using sockets (thus, the address of an active module is an IP socket address in a particular machine). Requests to execute goals in the module are sent through the socket by remote programs. When such a request arrives, the process running the active module takes it and executes it, returning through the socket the computed answers. These results are then taken and used by the remote processes. Backtracking over such remote calls works as usual and transparently. The only limitation (this may change in the future, but it is currently done for efficiency reasons) is that all alternative answers are precomputed (and cached) upon the first call to an active module and thus @emph{an active module should not export a predicate which has an infinite number of answers}. 

The first thing to do is to select a method whereby the client(s) (the module(s) that will use the active module) can find out in which machine/port (IP address/socket number) the server (i.e., the active module) will be listening once started, i.e., a ``protocol'' to communicate with the active module. The easiest way to do this is to make use of the redezvous methods which are provided in the Ciao distribution in the @code{library/actmods} directory; currently, @code{tmpbased...}, @code{filebased...}, and @code{webbased...}. 

The first one is based on saving the IP address and socket number of the server in a file in a predefined directory (generally @code{/tmp}, but this can be changed by changing @code{tmpbased_common.pl}). 

The second one is similar but saves the info in the directory in which the server is started (as @emph{<module_name>}@code{.addr}), or in the directory that a @code{.addr} file, if it exists, specifies. The clients must be started in the same directory (or have access to a file @code{.addr} specifying the same directory). However, they can be started in different machines, provided this directory is shared (e.g., by NFS or Samba), or the file can be moved to an appropriate directory on a different machine --provided the full path is the same. 

The third one is based on a 
@glindex name server
name server for active modules. When an active module is started, it communicates its address to the name server. When the client of the active module wants to communicate with it, it asks the name server the active module address. This is all done transparently to the user. The name server must be running when the active module is started (and, of course, when the application using it is executed). The location of the name server for an application must be specified in an application file named @code{webbased_common.pl} (see below). 

These rendezvous methods are encoded in two modules: a first one, called @code{...publish.pl}, is used by the server to publish its info. The second one, called @code{...locate.pl}, is used by the client(s) to locate the server info. For efficiency, the client methods maintain a cache of addresses, so that the server information only needs to be read from the file system the first time the active module is accessed. 

Active modules are compiled using the @code{-a} option of the Ciao compiler (this can also be done from the interactive top-level shell using 
@glindex make_actmod/2
@code{make_actmod/2}). For example, issuing the following command: 


@smallexample 
  ciaoc -a 'actmods/filebased_publish' simple_server
  @end smallexample  

compiles the simple server example that comes with the distribution (in the @code{actmods/example} directory). The @code{simple_client_with_main} example (in the same directory) can be compiled as usual: 


@smallexample 
  ciaoc simple_client_with_main
  @end smallexample  

Note that the client uses the @code{actmods} package, specifies the rendezvous method by importing @code{library('actmods/filebased_locate')}, and explicitely imports the ``remote'' predicates (@emph{implicit imports will not work}). Each module using the @code{actmods} package @emph{should only use one of the rendezvous methods}. 

Now, if the server is running (e.g., @code{simple_server &} in Un*x or double-clicking on it in Win32) when the client is executed it will connect with the server to access the predicate(s) that it imports from it. 

A simpler even client 
@glindex simple_client.pl
@code{simple_client.pl} can be loaded into the top level and its predicates called as usual (and they will connect with the server if it is running).

@subsection Active module name servers 

An application using a name server for active modules must have a file named @code{webbased_common.pl} that specifies where the name server resides. It must have the @code{URL} and the path which corresponds to that @code{URL} in the file system of the server machine (the one that hosts the @code{URL}) of the file that will hold the name server address. 

The current distribution provides a file @code{webbased_common.pl} that can be used (after proper setting of its contents) for a server of active modules for a whole installation. Alternatively, particular servers for each application can be set up (see below). 

The current distribution also provides a module that can be used as name server by any application. It is in file 
@glindex examples/webbased_server/webbased_server.pl
@code{examples/webbased_server/webbased_server.pl}. 

To set up a name server edit @code{webbased_common.pl} to change its contents appropriately as described above (@code{URL} and corresponding complete file path). Then recompile this library module: 
@smallexample 
    ciaoc -c webbased_common
  @end smallexample  
The name server has to be compiled as an active module itself: 
@smallexample 
    ciaoc -a actmods/webserver_publish webbased_server
  @end smallexample  
It has to be started in the server machine before the application and its active modules are compiled. 

Alternatively, you can copy @code{webbased_common.pl} and use it to set up name servers for particular applications. Currently, this is a bit complicated. You have to ensure that the name server, the application program, and all its active modules are compiled and executed with the same @code{webbased_common.pl} module. One way to do this is to create a subdirectory @code{actmods} under the directory of your application, copy @code{webbased_common.pl} to it, modify it, and then compile the name server, the application program, and its active modules using a library path that guarantees that your @code{actmods} directory is located by the compiler before the standard Ciao library. The same applies for when running all of them if the library loading is dynamic. 

One way to do the above is using the @code{-u} compiler option. Assume the following file: 
@smallexample 
     :- module(paths,[],[]).
     :- multifile library_directory/1.
     :- dynamic library_directory/1.
     :- initialization(asserta_fact(
	library_directory('/root/path/to/my/particular/application') )).
  @end smallexample  
then you have file @code{webbased_common.pl} in a subdirectory @code{actmods} of the above cited path. You have to compile the name server, the active modules, and the rest of the application with: 
@smallexample 
    ciaoc -u paths -s ...
  @end smallexample  
to use your particular @code{webbased_common.pl} and to make executables statically link libraries. If they are dynamic, then you have to provide for the above library_directory path to be set up upon execution. This can be done, for example, by including module @code{paths} into your executables. 

Addresses of active modules are saved by the name server in a subdirectory @code{webbased_db} of the directory where you start it ---see @code{examples/webbased_server/webbased_db/webbased_server}). This allows to restart the server right away if it dies (since it saves its state). This directory should be cleaned up regularly of addresses of active modules which are no more active. To do this, stop the server ---by killing it (its pid is in @code{PATH/FILE}), and restart it after cleaning up the files in the above mentioned directory.

@item
The package provides no means for security: the accessing application must take care of this (?).

@item
It can happen that there is a unique process for an active module serving calls from several different simultaneous executions of the same application. In this case, there might be unwanted interactions (e.g., if the active module has state).

@item
Applications may fail if the name server or an active module is restarted during execution of the application (since they restart at a different port than the one cached by the application).

@item
One may want name servers to reside at a fixed and known machine and port number (this is known as a @emph{service} and is defined in @code{/etc/services} in a Un*x machine). Currently, the port number changes in each invocation of the server.

@item
One may want to have one name server dedicated to a single application. Currently, there is no easy way to do this.

This package implements breadth-first execution of predicates. Predicates written with operators 
@glindex '<-'/1
@code{'<-'/1} (facts) and 
@glindex '<-'/2
@code{'<-'/2} (clauses) are executed using breadth-first search. This may be useful in search problems when a 
@glindex complete proof procedure

@smallexample 
:- module(chain, _, [bf]).

test(bf) :- bfchain(a,d).
test(df) :- chain(a,d).   % loops!

bfchain(X,X) <- .
bfchain(X,Y) <- arc(X,Z), bfchain(Z,Y).

chain(X,X).
chain(X,Y) :- arc(X,Z), chain(Z,Y).

@end smallexample  

There is another version, called 
@glindex bf/af
@code{bf/af}, which ensures AND-fairness by goal shuffling. This version correctly says ``@code{no}'' executing the following test: 
@smallexample

test :- sublistapp([a],[b]).

sublistapp(S,L) <- append(_,S,Y), append(Y,_,L).

This package applies a @emph{compiling control} technique to implement 
@coindex depth first iterative deepening
@glindex depth first iterative deepening
@emph{depth first iterative deepening} execution [Kor85]. It changes the usual @emph{depth-first} computation rule by 
@coindex iterative-deepening
@glindex iterative-deepening
@emph{iterative-deepening} on those predicates specifically marked. This is very useful in search problems when a 
@glindex complete proof procedure
complete proof procedure is needed. 

When this computation rule is used, first all goals are expanded only up to a given depth. If no solution is found or more solutions are needed by backtracking, the depth limit is incremented and the whole goal is repeated. Although it might seem that this approach is very inefficient because all higher levels are repeated for the deeper ones, it has been shown that is performs only about b/(b - 1) times as many operations than the corresponding breadth-first search, (where b is the branching factor of the proof tree) while the waste of memory is the same as depth first. 

The usage is by means of the following directive: 

@code{:- iterative(Name, FirstCut, Formula).} 

which states than the predicate 'Name' given in functor/arity form will be executed using iterative deepening rule starting at the depth 'FirstCut' with depth being incremented by the predicate 'Formula'. This predicate compute the new depth using the previous one. It must implement a dilating function i.e. the new depth must be greater. For example, to start with depth 5 and increment by 10 you can write: 

@code{:- iterative(p/1,5,f).} 

@code{f(X,Y) :- Y is X + 10.} 

or if you prefer, 

@code{:- iterative(p/1,5,(_(X,Y):- Y is X + 10)).} 


@coindex depth limit
@glindex depth limit 
You can also use a fourth parameter to set a limiting depth. All goals below the given depth limit simply fail. Thus, with the following directive: 

@code{:- iterative(p/1,5,(_(X,Y):- Y is X + 10),100).} 

all goals deeper than 100 will fail. 

An example of code using this package would be: 


@smallexample 
:- module(example_id, _,[id]).

test(id) :- 
        idchain(a,d).
test(df) :- 
        chain(a,d).   % loops!

:- iterative(idchain/2, 3, ( _(X,Z) :- Z is X + 1) ).

idchain(X,X).
idchain(X,Y) :- 
        arc(X,Z), 
        idchain(Z,Y).

chain(X,X).
chain(X,Y) :- 
        arc(X,Z), 
        chain(Z,Y).

arc(a,b).
arc(a,d).
arc(b,c).
arc(c,a).

@end smallexample  

The order of solutions are first the shallower and then the deeper. Solutions which are between two cutoff are given in the usual left to right order. For example, 


@smallexample 
% OLD EXAMPLE - Won't work!

:- module(_, _, [det_hook]).

:- use_module(engine(internals)).

pr(I, X, Y) :-
        display(open(I)), nl,
        '$metachoice'(C),
        det_try(pr2(X, Y, C), (display(close_done(I)), nl), (display(close_abort(I)), nl)).

pr2(X, _, _) :- X =< 0, !, fail.  
pr2(2, 2, C) :- '$metacut'(C).
pr2(X, Y, C) :- (X = Y ; X1 is X - 1, pr2(X1, Y, C)).
        
test1 :-
        pr(x, 4, X), pr(y, 4, Y), display(X), display(Y), nl, X = 1, Y = 3, !.


@end smallexample  

It is possible to preserve the iterative-deepening behavior for calls to predicates defined in other modules. These modules should obviously also use this package. In addition @emph{all} predicates from such modules should imported, i.e., the directive @code{:- use_module(module)}, should be used in this case instead of @code{:- use_module(module,[...])}. Otherwise calls to predicates outside the module will be treated in the usual way i.e. by depth-first computation. 

Another complete proof procedure implemented is the 
@glindex bf
@code{bf} package (
@glindex breadth first execution
breadth first execution).

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

This package impements an extension of prolog to deal with uncertainty. We implement a fuzzy prolog that models interval-valued fuzzy logic. This approach is more general than other fuzzy prologs in two aspects: 


@enumerate  
@item Truth values are sub-intervals on [0,1]. In fact, it could be a finite union of sub-intervals, as we will see below. Having a unique truth value is a particular case modeled with a unitary interval. 
@item Truth values are propagated through the rules by means of a set of @emph{aggregation operators}. The definition of an @emph{aggregation operator} is a generalization that subsumes conjunctive operators (triangular norms as min, prod, etc.), disjunctive operators (triangular co-norms as max, sum, etc.), average operators (averages as arithmetic average, cuasi-linear average, etc.) and hybrid operators (combinations of previous operators). 
@end enumerate  

We add uncertainty using CLP(R) instead of implementing a new fuzzy resolution as other fuzzy prologs. In this way, we use the original inference mechanism of Prolog, and we use the constraints and its operations provided by CLP(R) to handle the concept of partial truth. We represent intervals as constrains over real numbers and @emph{aggregation operators} as operations with constraints. 

Each fuzzy predicate has an additional argument which represents its truth value. We use ``:~'' instead of ``:-'' to distinguish fuzzy clauses from prolog clauses. In fuzzy clauses, truth values are obtained via an aggregation operator. There is also some syntactic sugar for defining fuzzy predicates with certain membership functions, the fuzzy counterparts of crisp predicates, and the fuzzy negation of a fuzzy predicate.

O'Ciao is a set of libraries which allows object-oriented programming in Ciao Prolog. It extends the Ciao Prolog module system by introducing two new concepts: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Inheritance. 
@item Instantiation. 
@end itemize  


@coindex Polymorphism
@glindex Polymorphism
@emph{Polymorphism} is the third fundamental concept provided by object oriented programming. This concept is not mentioned here since @strong{traditional PROLOG systems are polymorphic by nature}. 

Classes are declared in the same way as modules. However, they may be enriched with inheritance declarations and other object-oriented constructs. For an overview of the fundamentals of O'Ciao, see @uref{http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/~clip/papers/ociao-tr.ps.gz}. However, we will introduce the concepts in a tutorial way via examples.

@section Early examples 

The following one is a very simple example which declares a class -- a simple stack. Note that if you replace @emph{class/1} declaration with a @emph{module/1} declaration, it will compile correctly, and can be used as a normal Prolog module. 




@smallexample 
%%----------------------------------------------%%
%% A class for stacks.                          %%
%%----------------------------------------------%%

%% Class declaration: the current source defines a class.
:- class(stack,[],[]).

% State declaration: storage/1 is an attribute.
:- dynamic storage/1.

% Interface declaration: the following predicates will
% be available at run-time.
:- export(push/1).
:- export(pop/1).
:- export(top/1).
:- export(is_empty/0).

% Methods

push(Item) :-
        nonvar(Item), 
        asserta_fact(storage(Item)).

pop(Item) :-
        var(Item),
        retract_fact(storage(Item)).

top(Top) :-
        storage(Top), !.

is_empty :-
        storage(_), !, fail.
is_empty.

@end smallexample  

If we load this code at the Ciao toplevel shell: 


@smallexample 
        ?- use_package(objects).

        yes
        ?- use_class(library('class/examples/stack')).

        yes
        ?-
@end smallexample  

we can create two stack @emph{instances} : 


@smallexample 
        ?- St1 new stack,St2 new stack.

        St1 = stack('9254074093385163'),
        St2 = stack('9254074091') ? ,
@end smallexample  

and then, we can operate on them separately: 


@smallexample 
        1 ?- St1:push(8),St2:push(9).

        St1 = stack('9254074093385163'),
        St2 = stack('9254074091') ? 

        yes
        1 ?- St1:top(I),St2:top(K).

        I = 8,
        K = 9,
        St1 = stack('9254074093385163'),
        St2 = stack('9254074091') ? 

        yes
        1 ?-
@end smallexample  

The interesting point is that there are two stacks. If the previous example had been a normal module, we would have a stack , but @strong{only one} stack. 

The next example introduces the concepts of @emph{inheritable} predicate, @emph{constructor}, @emph{destructor} and @emph{virtual method}. Refer to the following sections for further explanation. 


@smallexample 
%%----------------------------------------------%%
%% A generic class for item storage.            %%
%%----------------------------------------------%%
:- class(generic).

% Public interface declaration:
:- export([set/1,get/1,callme/0]).

% An attribute
:- data datum/1.

% Inheritance declaration: datum/1 will be available to 
% descendant classes (if any).
:- inheritable(datum/1).

% Attribute initialization: attributes are easily initialized
% by writing clauses for them.
datum(none).

% Methods

set(X) :-
        type_check(X),
        set_fact(datum(X)).

get(X) :-
        datum(X).

callme :-
        a_virtual(IMPL),
        display(IMPL),
        display(' implementation of a_virtual/0 '),
        nl.

% Constructor: in this case, every time an instance
% of this class is created, it will display a message.
generic :-
        display(' generic class constructor '),
        nl.

% Destructor: analogous to the previous constructor,
% it will display a message every time an instance
% of this class is eliminated.
destructor :-
        display(' generic class destructor '),
        nl.

% Predicates:
% cannot be called as messages (X:method)

% Virtual declaration: tells the system to use the most
% descendant implementation of a_virtual/1 when calling
% it from inside this code (see callme/0).
% If there is no descendant implementation for it, 
% the one defined bellow will be used.
:- virtual a_virtual/1.

a_virtual(generic).

:- virtual type_check/1.

type_check(X) :-
        nonvar(X).

@end smallexample  

And the following example, is an extension of previous class. This is performed by establishing an inheritance relationship: 


@smallexample 
%%----------------------------------------------%%
%% This class provides additional functionality %%
%% to the "generic" class.                      %%
%%----------------------------------------------%%
:- class(specific).

% Establish an inheritance relationship with class "generic".
:- inherit_class(library('class/examples/generic')).

% Override inherited datum/1.
% datum/1 is said to be overriden because there are both an
% inherited definition (from class "generic") and a local one,
% which overrides the one inherited.
:- data datum/1. 
:- inheritable datum/1.

% Extend the public interface inherited from "generic".
% note that set/1 and a_virtual/0 are also overriden. 
% undo/0 is a new functionality added.
:- export([set/1,undo/0]).

% Methods

set(Value) :-
        inherited datum(OldValue),
        !,
        inherited set(Value),
        asserta_fact(datum(OldValue)).
set(Value) :-
        inherited set(Value).

undo :-
        retract_fact(datum(Last)), !,
        asserta_fact(inherited(datum(Last))).
undo :-
        retractall_fact(inherited(datum(_))).

% Constructor
specific :-
        generic,
        retractall_fact(inherited(datum(_))),
        display(' specific class constructor '),
        nl.

% Destructor
destructor :-
        display(' specific class destructor '),
        nl.

% Predicates

% New implementation of a_virtual/1. 
% Since this predicate was declared virtual, the
% implementation below will be called from the inherited 
% method callme/0 instead of the version defined at "generic".
a_virtual(specific).

@section Recommendations on when to use objects 



We would like to give some advice in the use of object oriented programming, in conjunction with the declarative paradigm. 

You should reconsider using O'Ciao in the following cases: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item The pretended "objects" have no state,i.e., no data or dynamic predicates. In this case, a normal module will suffice. 


@item There is state, but there will be only one instance of a pretended class. Again, a module suffices. 


@item The "objects" are data structures (list,trees,etc) already supported by Prolog. However, it does make sense to model, using objects, data structures whose change implies a side-effect such as drawing a particular window on the screen. 


@end itemize  

We recommend the usage of O'Ciao in the following cases: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item You feel you will need to have several copies of a "module". 
@item Local copies of a module are needed instead of a global module beeing modified by several ones. 
@item The "classes" are a representation of external entities to Prolog. For example: the X-Window system. 
@item There is state or code outside the Prolog system which needs to be manipulated. For example: interfaces to Java or Tcl/Tk code. 
@item You are not familiar with Prolog, but you know about object oriented programming. O'Ciao may be used as a learning tool to introduce yourself on the declarative programming paradigm. 


@end itemize  



@node Limitations on object usage,  , Recommendations on when to use objects, Object oriented programming
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Limitations on object usage 

O'Ciao run-time speed is limited by the usage of meta-programming structures, for instance: @code{X = (Object:mymethod(25)), call(X)}. O'Ciao will optimize static manipulation of objects (those that can be determined at compile time).

O'Ciao classes are declared in the same way as traditional prolog modules. The general mechanism of @emph{source expansion} will translate object-oriented declarations to normal prolog code. This is done transparently to the user. 

Abstract 
@coindex interfaces
@glindex interfaces
@emph{interfaces} are restricted classes which declare exported predicates with no implementation. The implementation itselt will be provided by some class using an 
@glindex implements/1
@code{implements/1} declaration. Only 
@glindex export/1
@code{export/1} and 
@glindex data/1
@code{data/1} declarations are allowed when declaring an interface. Normal classes may treated as interfaces just ignoring all exported predicate implementations.

@cartouche
@itemize @bullet{}

@item @strong{Library usage:}

To declare a class the compiler must be told to use the @code{class} @emph{source expansion}. To do so, source code must start with a module declaration which loads the class package: 
@smallexample  
           :- class(ClassName).
@end smallexample  
@noindent
or a 
@glindex module/3
@code{module/3} declaration, as follows: 
@smallexample  
           :- module(ClassName,[],[class]).
@end smallexample  


@noindent

@glindex interfaces
interfaces are declared in a similar way: 
@smallexample  
           :- interface(InterfaceName).
@end smallexample  

Please, do not use SICStus-like module declaration, with a non-empty export list. In other case, some non-sense errors will be reported by normal Ciao module system. 

Most of the regular Ciao declarations may be used when defining a class, such as 
@glindex concurrent/1
@code{concurrent/1},
@glindex dynamic/1
@code{dynamic/1}, 
@glindex discontiguous/1
@code{discontiguous/1},
@glindex multifile/1
@code{multifile/1}, and so on. 

However, there are some restrictions wich apply to those declarations: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item 
@glindex meta_predicate/1
@code{meta_predicate/1} declaration is not allowed to hold 
@coindex addmodule and pred(N) meta-arguments
@glindex addmodule and pred(N) meta-arguments
@emph{addmodule and pred(N) meta-arguments}, except for previously declared multifiles. 
@item Attribute and multifile predicates must be declared before any clause of the related predicate. 
@item There is no sense in declaring an attribute as meta_predicate. 
@end itemize  

It is a good practique to put all your declarations at the very begining of the file, just before the code itself.

O'Ciao attributes are restricted to hold simple facts. It is not possible to hold a Head :- Body clause at an instance attribute. 

Notice that attributes are

@emph{multi-evaluated} by nature, and may be manipulated by the habitual @strong{assert/retract} family of predicates.

Notice that inheritance is

@emph{virtual} predicates give a chance to handle, in an uniform way, different implementations of the same functionality. 

Whether a virtual predicate is declared as a method, there must be at least one clause of it present at current source. Whenever no special implementation is needed at current class, a never-fail/allways-fail clause may be defined (depending on your needs). For example: 


@smallexample 
   :- virtual([ test1/1 , test2/2 ]).
   test1(_).
   test2(_,_) :- fail.
@end smallexample  

This kind of virtual methods are also known as 
@coindex abstract methods
@glindex abstract methods
@emph{abstract methods}, since implementation is fully delegated to descendant classes. 

An attribute may be also declared as a virtual one, but there is no need to write clauses for it.

A

@glindex constructor
@emph{constructor} is a special case of method which complains the following conditions: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item The constructor functor matches the current class name. 
@item A constructor may hold any number of arguments. 
@item If an inheritance relationship was defined, an inherited constructor must be manually called (see below). 
@item When instance creation takes place, any of the declared constructors are implicitly called. The actual constructor called depends on the 
@glindex new/2
@code{new/2} goal specified by the user. 
@end itemize  

This is a simple example of constructor declaration for the foo class: 


@smallexample 
           foo :- 
               display('an instance was born').
@end smallexample  

Constructor declaration is not mandatory, and there may be more than one constructor declarations (with different arity) at the source code. 

This functionality is usefull when some computation is needed at instance creation. For example: opening a socket, clearing the screen, etc. 

Whenever an inheritance relationship is established, and there is any constructor defined at the super class, you must call manually an inherited constructor. Here is an example: 


@smallexample 
           :- class(foo).
           :- inherit_class(myclass).

           foo :-
               myclass(0),
               display('an instance was born').

           foo(N) :- myclass(N).
@end smallexample  

Consequences may be unpredictable, if you forget to call an inherited constructor. You should also take care not to call an inherited constructor twice. 

All defined constructors are inheritable by default. A constructor may also be declared as public (by the user), but it is not mandatory.

A destructor will never be wanted to be part of the public interface, and there is no need to mark them as inheritable, since all inherited destructors are called by O'Ciao just before yours.

This describes the errors reported when declaring a class or an interface. The first section will explain compile-time errors, this is, any semantic error which may be determined at compile time. The second section will explain run-time errors, this is, any exception that may be raisen by the incorrect usage of O'Ciao. Some of those errors may be not reported at compile time, due to the use of meta-programational structures. For example: 

@code{functor(X,my_method,0),call(X).} 

O'Ciao is not able to check whether my_method/0 is a valid method or not. So, this kind of checking is left to run time.

@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @strong{ERROR : multiple inheritance not allowed.} 

There are two or more inherit_class/1 declarations found at your code. Only one declaration is allowed, since there is no multiple code inheritance support. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid inheritance declaration.} 

The given parameter to inherit_class/1 declaration is not a valid path to a Prolog source. 


@item @strong{ERROR : sorry, addmodule meta-arg is not allowed at @emph{F/A}. } 

You are trying to declare @emph{F/A} as meta-predicate, and one of the meta-arguments is @emph{addmodule}. This is not allowed in O'Ciao due to implementation restrictions. For example: 

@code{:- meta_predicate example(addmodule).} 

@code{example(X,FromModule) :- call(FromModule:X).} 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid attribute declaration for @emph{Arg}. } 

Argument to data/1 or dynamic/1 declaration is not a valid predicate specification of the form @emph{Functor/Arity}. For example: 

@code{:- data attr.} 

@code{:- dynamic attr(_).} 

@code{:- data attr/m.} 

etc,etc... 


@item @strong{ERROR : pretended attribute @emph{F/A} was assumed to be a method.} 

You put some clauses of @emph{F/A} before the corresponding data/1 or dynamic/1 declaration. For example: 

@code{attr(initial_value).} 

@code{:- data attr/1.} 

It is a must to declare attributes before any clause of the given predicate. 


@item @strong{ERROR : destructor/0 is not allowed to be an attribute.} 

There is a :- data(destructor/0) or :- dynamic(destructor/0). declaration in your code. This is not allowed since destructor/0 is a reserved predicate, and must be allways a method. 


@item @strong{ERROR : @emph{Constructor} is not allowed to be an attribute.} 

As the previos error, you are trying to declare a constructor as an attribute. A constructor must be allways a method. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid multifile: destructor/0 is a reserved predicate.} 

There is a :- multifile(destructor/0). declaration in your code. This is not allowed since destructor/0 is a reserved predicate, and must be allways a method. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid multifile: @emph{Constructor} is a reserved predicate.} 

As the previos error, you are trying to declare a constructor as a multifile. Any constructor must allways be a method. 


@item @strong{ERROR : multifile declaration of @emph{F/A} ignored: it was assumed to be a method.} 

You put some clauses of @emph{F/A} before the corresponding multifile/1 declaration. For example: 

example(a,b). 

@code{:- multifile example/2.} 

Multifile predicates must be declared before any clause of the given predicate. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid multifile declaration: multifile(@emph{Arg}). } 

Given argument to multifile/1 declaration is not a valid predicate specification, of the form @emph{Functor/Arity}. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid public declaration: @emph{Arg}. } 

Given argument @emph{Arg} to public/1 or export/1 declaration is not a valid predicate specification, of the form @emph{Functor/Arity}. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid inheritable declaration: inheritable(@emph{Arg}). } 

Given argument @emph{Arg} to inheritable/1 declaration is not a valid predicate specification, of the form @emph{Functor/Arity}. 


@item @strong{ERROR : destructor/0 is not allowed to be virtual.} 

There is a :- virtual(destructor/0) declaration present at your code. Destructors and/or constructors are not allowed to be virtual. 


@item @strong{ERROR : @emph{Constructor} is not allowed to be virtual.} 

As the previous error, you are trying to declare a constructor as virtual. This is not allowed. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid virtual declaration: virtual(@emph{Arg}). } 

Given argument to virtual/1 declaration is not a valid predicate specification, of the form @emph{Functor/Arity}. 


@item @strong{ERROR : clause of @emph{F/A} ignored : only facts are allowed as initial state.} 

You declared @emph{F/A} as an attribute, then you put some clauses of that predicate in the form @emph{Head :- Body}. For example: 

@code{:- data my_attribute/1.} 

@code{my_attribute(X) :- X>=0 , X<=2.} 

This is not allowed since attributes are assumed to hold simple facts. The correct usage for those @emph{initialization clauses} is: 

@code{:- data my_attribute/1.} 

@code{my_attribute(0).} 

@code{my_attribute(1).} 

@code{my_attribute(2).} 


@item @strong{ERROR : multifile @emph{F/A} is not allowed to be public.} 

The given @emph{F/A} predicate is both present at multifile/1 and public/1 declarations. For example: 

@code{:- public(p/1).} 

@code{:- multifile(p/1).} 

This is not allowed since multifile predicates are not related to Object Oriented Programming. 


@item @strong{ERROR : multifile @emph{F/A} is not allowed to be inheritable.} 

Analogous to previous error. 


@item @strong{ERROR : multifile @emph{F/A} is not allowed to be virtual.} 

Analogous to previous error. 


@item @strong{ERROR : virtual @emph{F/A} must be a method or attribute defined at this class.} 

There is a virtual/1 declaration for @emph{F/A}, but there is not any clause of that predicate nor a 
@glindex data/1
@code{data/1} declaration. You must declare at least one clause for every virtual method. Virtual attributes does not require any clause but a 
@glindex data/1
@code{data/1} declaration must be present. 


@item @strong{ERROR : implemented interface @emph{Module} is not a valid interface.} 

There is an 
@glindex implements/1
@code{implements/1} declaration present at your code where given @emph{Module} is not declared as class nor interface. 


@item @strong{ERROR : predicate @emph{F/A} is required both as method (at @emph{Itf1} interface) and attribute (at @emph{Itf2} interface).} 

There is no chance to give a correct implementation for @emph{F/A} predicate since @emph{Itf1} and @emph{Itf2} interfaces require different definitions. To avoid this error, you must remove one of the related 
@glindex implements/1
@code{implements/1} declaration. 


@item @strong{ERROR : inherited @emph{Source} must be a class.} 

There is an :- inherit_class(@emph{Source}) declaration, but that source was not declared as a class. 


@item @strong{ERROR : circular inheritance: @emph{Source} is not a valid super-class.} 

Establishing an inheritance relationship with @emph{Source} will cause current class to be present twice in the inheritance line. This is not allowed. The cause of this is error is simple : There is some inherited class from @emph{Source} which also establishes an inheritance relationship with current source. 


@item @strong{ERROR : method/attribute @emph{F/A} must be implemented.} 

Some of the implemented interfaces requires @emph{F/A} to be defined, but there is no definition for such predicate, even an inherited one. 


@item @strong{ERROR : local implementation of @emph{F/A} hides inheritable/public definition.} 

There is an inherited definition for @emph{F/A} which is been redefined at current class, but there is no valid inheritable/public declaration for the last one. Overriden public predicates must be also declared as public. Overriden inheritable predicates must be declared either as public or inheritable. 


@item @strong{ERROR : public predicate @emph{F/A} was not defined nor inherited.} 

There is a 
@glindex public/1
@code{public/1} declaration for @emph{F/A}, but there is no definition for it at current class nor an inherited one. 


@item @strong{ERROR : argument to self/1 must be a free variable.} 

Argument to self/1 is not a variable, for example: @code{self(abc)}. 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown inherited attribute in @emph{Goal}.} 

@emph{Goal} belongs to assert/retract family of predicates, and given argument is not a valid inherited attribute. The most probable causes of this error are: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item The given predicate is defined at super-class, but you forgot to mark it as inheritable (or public), at such class. 
@item The given predicate was not defined (at super-class) as an attribute, just as a method. 
@end itemize  


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown inherited goal: @emph{Goal}.} 

The given @emph{Goal} was not found at super-class, or it is not accessible. Check whether @emph{Goal} was marked as inheritable (or public) at super-class. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid argument: @emph{F/A} is not an attribute.} 

You are trying to pass a method as an argument to any predicate which expect a @emph{fact} predicate. 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown inherited fact: @emph{Fact}.} 

There is a call to any predicate which expects a @emph{fact} argument (those declared as data or dynamic),but the actual argument is not an inherited attribute.For example: 

@code{asserta_fact(inherited(not_an_attribute(8)))} 

where not_an_attribute/1 was not declared as data or dynamic by the super-class (or corresponding ascendant). 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown inherited spec: @emph{F/A}.} 

There is a reference to an inherited predicate specification, but the involved predicate has not been inherited. 


@item @strong{WARNING : meta-predicate specification of @emph{F/A} ignored since this is an attribute.} 

You declared @emph{F/A} both as an attribute and a meta-predicate. For example: 

@code{:- meta_predicate attr(goal).} 

@code{:- data attr/1.} 

There is no sense in declaring an attribute as meta-predicate. 


@item @strong{WARNING : class destructor is public} 

There is a :- public(destructor/0) declaration present at your code. Marking a destructor as public is a very bad idea since anybody may destroy or corrupt an instance before the proper time. 


@item @strong{WARNING : class destructor is inheritable} 

Analogous to previous error. 


@item @strong{WARNING : There is no call to inherited constructor/s} 

You have not declared any constructor at your class, but there is any inherited constructor that should be called. Whenever you do not need constructors, but there is an inheritance relationship (where super-class declares a constructor), you should write a simple constructor as the following example: 
@smallexample 
   :- class(myclass).
   :- inherit_class(other_class).

   myclass :-
           other_class.
@end smallexample  


@item @strong{WARNING : multifile @emph{F/A} hides inherited predicate.} 

You declared as multifle a predicate which matches an inherited predicate name. Any reference to the inherited predicate must be done by the ways of the inherited/1 qualificator.

O'Ciao works in conjunction with the Ciao Prolog module system, which also reports its own error messages. This will cause Ciao to report a little criptic error messages due to the general mechanism of source-to-source expansion. Those are some tips you must consider when compiling a class:

@item The instance identifier will not be a variable, it must be provided by the user, and must be unique. 


@item Instance creation will never fail, even if the constructor fails. 
@end itemize  

For every statically declared object the given constructor will be called at program startup. Those instances may be destroyed manually, but it is not recommended. 

When reloading the involved class from the Ciao toplevel shell. It may destroy statically declared instances, and create them again. 

Statically declared instances must be called using a specifically designed module-qualification: @code{ClassName(Object):Goal}. For example: 
@smallexample 
    :- module(example,[main/0],[objects]).
    :- use_class(library(counter)).

@section Other information (@code{objects})

 Compile-time errors are restricted to some local analysis. Since there is no type declaration in the Prolog language, there is no posibility to determine whenever a given variable will hold an instance of any class. 

However, little semantic analysis is performed. User may aid to perform such an analysis by the usage of run time checks (which are also detected at compile time), or static declarations. For example: 

@code{clause(Obj) :- Obj:a_method(334).} 

O'Ciao may be not able to determine whenever a_method/1 is a valid method for instance Obj, unless some help is provided: 

@code{clause(Obj) :- Obj instance_of myclass,Obj:a_method(334).} 

In such case, O'Ciao will report any semantic error at compile-time. 
 
Most of the run-time errors are related to normal Ciao Prolog module system. Since objects are treated as normal Prolog modules at run time, there is no further documentation here about that stuff.

@item @strong{ERROR : invalid instance identifier @emph{ID}: must be an atom} 

There is a 
@glindex instance_of/2
@code{instance_of/2} or 
@glindex new/2
@code{new/2} declaration where first argument @emph{ID} must be an unique atom, but currently it is not. Statically declared instances needs an identifier to be provided by the user. 


@item @strong{ERROR : instance identifier @emph{ID} already in use} 

There are two or more 
@glindex instance_of/2
@code{instance_of/2} declarations with the same first argument @emph{ID}. Instance identifiers must be unique. 


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid use_class/1 declaration: @emph{SourceFile} is not a class} 

Those are the causes for this error: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item The given @emph{SourceFile} does not exist, or is not accesible. 


@item The given @emph{SourceFile} is not a Prolog source. 


@item The given @emph{SourceFile} is a valid Prolog source, but it does not declare a class. 


@end itemize  


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown class on @emph{ID} instance declaration} 

The class defined on the 
@glindex instance_of/2
@code{instance_of/2} declaration for @emph{ID} instance has not been loaded by a 
@glindex use_class/1
@code{use_class/1} declaration. 


@item @strong{ERROR : instance identifier @emph{ID} is an exisisting Prolog module} 

There is an statically declared instance whose identifier may cause interference with the Ciao Prolog module system. Use another instance identifier. 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown constructor on @emph{ID} instance declaration} 

The given constructor on the 
@glindex instance_of/2
@code{instance_of/2} declaration for @emph{ID} has not been defined at the corresponding class. 


@item @strong{ERROR : constructor is needed on @emph{ID} instance declaration} 

No constructor was defined on the 
@glindex instance_of/2
@code{instance_of/2} declaration for @emph{ID} and default constructor is not allowed. You must provide a constructor. 


@item @strong{ERROR : static instance @emph{ID} was derived from a different constructor at @emph{AnotherModule}} 

@emph{ID} has been declared to be an static instance both on @emph{AnotherModule} and current source, but different constructors were used. The most probable causes for this error are: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Occasionally, there is another module using the same instance identifier and it was not noticed by you. Another different identifier may be used instead. 


@item It was you intention to use the same object as declared by the other module. In this case, the same constructor must be used. 


@end itemize  


@item @strong{ERROR : invalid first argument in call to new(@emph{Arg},_)} 

There is a new/1 goal in your code where first argument is not a free variable. For example: 

@code{myobj new myclass} 

First argument must be a variable in order to receive a run-time generated object identifier. 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown class in call to new(?,@emph{Constructor}) } 

The given @emph{Constructor} in call to new/2 does not correspond to any used class at current code. The most probable cause of this may be: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item You forgot to include a 
@glindex use_class/1
@code{use_class/1} declaration in your code. 


@item There is a spelling mistake in the constructor.For example: 

:- use_class(myclass). 

foo(X) :- X new mclass. 


@end itemize  


@item @strong{ERROR : can not create an instance from an interface: new(?,@emph{Constructor}) } 

Given @emph{Constructor} references an interface rather than a class. Instances can not be derived from interface-expanded code. 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown constructor in call to new(?,@emph{Constructor}) } 

As the previous error, there is a mistake in the given @emph{Constructor}. This error is reported when you are trying to call a constructor which was not defined at the corresponding class. Check the class definition to find what is going on. 

Another cause for this error is the incorrect usage of the 
@glindex default constructor
default constructor. Whenever there are one or more constructors defined at the involved class, you are restricted to chose one of them. This seems that default constructor will be available, if and only if, there are no constructors defined at the involved class. 


@item @strong{ERROR : call to non-public @emph{ID:Goal}} 

You are trying to call a method which was not declared as public by the class specified in 
@glindex instance_of/2
@code{instance_of/2} declaration for @emph{ID}. 


@item @strong{ERROR : call to inaccessible predicate at instance @emph{ID:Goal}} 

There is a call to @emph{Goal} at statically declared instance @emph{ID} which is unknown or was not declared as public. 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown instance @emph{ID} of class @emph{Class} at @emph{Goal}} 

There is a call to @emph{Goal} where involved statically declared instance @emph{ID} is unknown or is not derived from @emph{Class}. Check whether it was declared by a 
@glindex instance_of/2
@code{instance_of/2} declaration. 


@item @strong{ERROR : inaccessible attribute @emph{Fact} at instance @emph{ID}} 

There is an attempt to use @emph{ID:Fact} but it was not declared as public. 


@item @strong{ERROR : unknown attribute @emph{Fact} at instance @emph{ID}} 

There is an attempt to use @emph{ID:Fact} but it is unknown or it is not an attribute (may be a method). 


@item @strong{WARNING : invalid call to new(?,_)} 

There is a call to new/2 in you code where first argument variable has been determined to hold any other instance. For example: 

@code{foo :- X new myclass,X new otherclass.} 

or 

@code{foo(X) :- X instance_of myclass, X new myclass.} 

The related call to new/2 will allways fail. 


@item @strong{WARNING : called @emph{Goal} is not public at any used class} 

There is a call to @emph{Var}:@emph{Goal} where @emph{Var} has not been determined to be compatible with any class. However, @emph{Goal} is not public at any class specified by the 
@glindex use_class/1
@code{use_class/1} declaration. 

This is a warning (not an error) since @emph{Var}:@emph{Goal} may be not related to Object Oriented Programing.

This library provides run-time support for 
@glindex object
object creation and manipulation. Objects are also called 
@glindex class instances
class instances, or simply 
@glindex instances
instances. 

Objects in Ciao are treated as normal modules. This is, an object is a run-time generated Prolog module, which may be identified by an unique term across the whole application. 

This is a very simple example of how to create an instance, and how to make calls to it: 


@smallexample 
            AnObj new myclass,
            AnObj:mymethod.
         @end smallexample  

In order to make any object accessible from code, an usage relationship must be established between the class (from which instances are derived) and the code itself. Refer to 
@glindex use_class/1
@code{use_class/1} predicate or 
@glindex use_class/1
@code{use_class/1} declaration in order to do so.

@deffn PREDICATE new/2:



Dynamic instance creation takes place by the ways of this predicate. 

It takes a free variable as first argument which will be instantiated to an internal object identifier. 

Second argument must be instantiated to a 
@glindex class constructor
class constructor. Class constructors are designed to perform an initialization on the new created instance. Notice that instance initialization may involve some kind of computation, not only @emph{state initialization}. 

A class constructor is made by a functor, which must match the intended class name, and any number of parameters. For example: 


@smallexample 
            Obj new myclass(1500,'hello, world!!!')
         @end smallexample  

Those parameters depends (obviously) on the constructors defined at the class source. If no constructors where defined, no parameters are needed. This is called the 
@glindex default constructor
default constructor. An example: 


@smallexample 
            Obj new myclass
         @end smallexample  

The default constructor can not be called if there is any constructor available at the class source. 

Instantiation will raise an exception and fail whenever any of this conditions occur: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item First argument is not a free variable. 
@item Second argument functor is a class, but there is no usage relationship with it.

@item
Usage of objects from the @code{user} module does not work properly. It is better to use the @code{objects} package in a (proper) module.

@item
Not really a bug: when loading code which declares static instances from the toplevel shell, predicate 
@glindex use_module/1
@code{use_module/1}) will not work properly: those instances may be not correctly created, and predicates will fail whenever they are not supposed to do. This may be avoided by reloading again the involved module, but make sure it is modified and saved to disk before doing so.

Ciao Prolog includes a high-level, flexible way to interface C and Prolog, based on the use of assertions to declare what are the expected types and modes of the arguments of a Prolog predicate, and which C files contain the corresponding code. To this end, the user provides: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item A set of C files, or a precompiled shared library, 
@item A Ciao Prolog module defining whith predicates are implemented in the C files and the types and modes of their arguments, and 
@item an (optional) set of flags required for the compilation of the files. 
@end itemize  

The Ciao Prolog compiler analyzes the Prolog code written by the user and gathers this information in order to generate automatically C "glue" code implementing the data translation between Prolog and C, and to compile the C code into dynamically loadable C object files, which are linked automatically when needed.

@node Declaration of Types, Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C types, Foreign Language Interface, Foreign Language Interface
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Declaration of Types 

Each predicate implemented as a foreign C function must have accompanying declarations in the Ciao Prolog associated file stating the types and modes of the C function. A sample declaration for @code{prolog_predicate} which is implemented as @code{foreign_function_name} is: 
 
@smallexample  
     :- true pred prolog_predicate(m1(Arg1), ... mN(ArgN)) :: 
                  type1 * ... * typeN + 
                  (foreign(foreign_function_name), returns(ArgR)).
   @end smallexample  

where @code{m1}, ..., @code{mN} and @code{type1}, ..., @code{typeN} are respectively the modes and types of the arguments. @code{foreign_function_name} is the name of the C function implementing 
@glindex prolog_predicate/N
@code{prolog_predicate/N}, and the result of this function is unified with @code{ArgR}, which must be one of @code{Arg1} ... @code{ArgN}. 

This notation can be simplified in several ways. If the name of the foreign function is the same as the name of the Ciao Prolog predicate, @code{foreign(foreign_function_name)} can be replaced by @code{foreign/0}. @code{returns(ArgR)} specifies that the result of the function corresponds to the @code{ArgR} argument of the Ciao Prolog predicate. If the foreign function does not return anything (or if its value is ignored), then @code{returns(ArgR)} must be removed. Note that @code{returns} cannot be used without @code{foreign}. A simplified, minimal form is thus: 


@smallexample  
     :- true pred prolog_predicate(m1(Arg1), ... mN(ArgN)) :: 
                  type1 * ... * typeN + foreign.
   @end smallexample

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C types 

The automatic translation between Ciao Prolog and C types is defined (at the moment) only for some simple but useful types. The translation to be performed is solely defined by the types of the arguments in the Ciao Prolog file (i.e., no inspection of the corresponding C file is done). The names (and meaning) of the types known for performing that translation are to be found in @ref{Foreign Language Interface Properties}; they are also summarized below (Prolog types are on the left, and the corresponding C types on the right): 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item num <-> double 
@item int <-> int 
@item atm <-> char * 
@item string <-> char * (with trailing zero) 
@item byte_list <-> char * (a buffer of bytes, with associated length) 
@item int_list <-> int * (a buffer of integers, with associated length) 
@item address <-> void * 
@end itemize  

Strings, atoms, and lists of bytes are passed to (and from) C as dynamically (@code{ciao_malloc}) created arrays of characters (bytes). Those arrays are freed by Ciao Prolog upon return of the foreign function unless the property 
@glindex do_not_free/2
@code{do_not_free/2} is specified (see examples below). This caters for the case in which the C files save in a private state (either by themselves, or by a library function being called by them) the values passed on from Prolog. The type 
@glindex byte_list/1
@code{byte_list/1} requires an additional property, 
@glindex size_of/2
@code{size_of/2}, to indicate which argument represents its size. 
 
Empty lists of bytes and integers are converted into C @code{NULL} pointers, and vice versa. Empty strings (@code{[]}) and null atoms ('') are converted into zero-length, zero-ended C strings (@emph{""}). C @code{NULL} strings and empty buffers (i.e., buffers with zero length) are transformed into the empty list or the null atom (@code{''}). 

Most of the work is performed by the predicates in the @ref{Foreign Language Interface Builder}, which can be called explicitly by the user. Doing that is not usually needed, since the Ciao Prolog Compiler takes care of building glue code files an of compiling and linking whatever is necessary. 
 

@node Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C modes, Custom access to Prolog from C, Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C types, Foreign Language Interface
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C modes 

The (prefix) @code{+/1} ISO mode (or, equivalently, the in/1 mode) states that the corresponding Prolog argument is ground at the time of the call, and therefore it is an input argument in the C part; this groundness is automatically checked upon entry. The (prefix) @code{-/1} ISO mode (or, equivalently, the go/1 mode) states that Prolog expects the C side to generate a (ground) value for that argument. Arguments with output mode should appear in C functions as pointers to the corresponding base type (as it is usual with C), i.e., an argument which is an integer generated by the C file, declared as 


@smallexample 
:- true pred get_int(go(ThisInt)) :: int + foreign
@end smallexample  

or as 


@smallexample 
:- true pred get_int(-ThisInt) :: int + foreign
@end smallexample  

should appear in the C code as 


@smallexample 
void get_int(int *thisint)
@{
        ....
@}
@end smallexample  

Note the type of the (single) argument of the function. Besides, the return value of a function can always be used as an output argument, just by specifying to which Prolog arguments it corresponds, using the @code{foreing/1} property. The examples below illustrate this point, and the use of several assertions to guide the compilation. 



@node Custom access to Prolog from C, Examples, Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C modes, Foreign Language Interface
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Custom access to Prolog from C 

Automatic type conversions does not cover all the possible cases. When the automatic type conversion is not enough (or if the user, for any reason, does not want to go through the automatic conversion), it is possible to instruct Ciao Prolog not to make implicit type conversion. The strategy in that case is to pass the relevant argument(s) with a special type (a @code{ciao_term}) which can represent any term which can be built in Prolog. Operations to construct, traverse, and test this data abstraction from C are provided. The prototypes of these operations are placed on the @code{"ciao_prolog.h"} file, under the @code{include} subdirectory of the installation directory (the Ciao Prolog compiler knowns where it has been installed, and gives the C compiler the appropriate flags). This @emph{non direct correspondence} mode is activated whenever a Ciao Prolog type unknown to the foreign interface (i.e., none of these in @ref{Foreign Language Interface Properties}) or the type @code{any_term} (which is explicitly recognised by the foreign language interface) is found. The latter is preferred, as it is much more informative, and external tools, as the the 
@glindex CiaoPP
CiaoPP preprocessor, can take advantage of them.

@subsection Term construction 

All term construction primitives return an argument of type @code{ciao_term}, which is the result of constructing a term. All Ciao Prolog terms can be built using the interface operations @code{ciao_var()}, @code{ciao_structure()}, @code{ciao_integer()}, and @code{ciao_float()}. There are, however, variants and specialized versions of these operations which can be freely intermixed. Using one version or another is a matter of taste and convenience. We list below the prototypes of the primitives in order of complexity. 

Throughout this section, @strong{true}, when referred to a boolean value, correspond to the integer value @code{1}, and @strong{false} correspond to the integer value @code{0}, as is customary in C boolean expressions. These values also available as the (predefined) constants @code{ciao_true} and @code{ciao_false}, both of type @code{ciao_bool}. 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item @code{ciao_term ciao_var();} 

Returns a fresh, unbound variable. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_integer(int i);} 

Creates a term, representing an integer from the Prolog point of view, from a C integer. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_float(double i);} 

Creates a term, representing a floating point number, from a floating point number. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_put_number_chars(char *number_string);} 

It converts @code{number_string} (which must a string representing a syntactically valid number) into a @code{ciao_term}. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_atom(char *name);} 

Creates an atom whose printable name is given as a C string. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_structure_a(char *name, int arity, ciao_term *args);} 

Creates a structure with name 'name' (i.e., the functor name ), arity 'arity' and the components of the array 'args' as arguments: @code{args[0]} will be the first argument, @code{args[1]} the second, and so on. The 'args' array itself is not needed after the term is created, and can thus be a variable local to a procedure. An atom can be represented as a 0-arity structure (with @code{ciao_structure(name, 0)}), and a list cell can be constructed using the '.'/2 structure name. The @code{_a} suffix stands for @emph{array}. 
 
@item @code{ciao_term ciao_structure(char *name, int arity, ...);} 

Similar to ciao_structure_a, but the C arguments after the arity are used to fill in the arguments of the structure. 
 
@item @code{ciao_term ciao_list(ciao_term head, ciao_term tail);} 

Creates a list from a @code{head} and a @code{tail}. It is equivalent to @code{ciao_structure(".", 2, head, tail)}. 
 
@item @code{ciao_term ciao_empty_list();} 

Creates an empty list. It is equivalent to @code{ciao_atom("[]")}. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_listn_a(int len, ciao_term *args);} 

Creates a list with 'len' elements from the array @code{args}. The @emph{nth} element of the list (starting at 1) is @code{args[n-1]} (starting at zero). 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_listn(int length, ...);} 

Like @code{ciao_listn_a()}, but the list elements appear explicitly as arguments in the call. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_dlist_a(int len, ciao_term *args, ciao_term base);} 

Like @code{ciao_listn_a}, but a difference list is created. @code{base} whill be used as the tail of the list, instead of the empty list. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_dlist(int length, ...);} 

Similar to @code{ciao_dlist_a()} with a variable number of arguments. The last one is the tail of the list. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_copy_term(ciao_term src_term);} 

Returns a new copy of the @code{term}, with fresh variables (as @code{copy_term/2} does).

@subsection Testing the Type of a Term 

A @code{ciao_term} can contain @emph{any} Prolog term, and its implementation is opaque to the C code. Therefore the only way to know reliably what data is passed on is using explicit functions to test term types. Below, @code{ciao_bool} is a type defined in @code{"ciao_prolog.h"} which can take the values 1 (for @strong{true}) and 0 (for @strong{false}). 
 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_is_variable(ciao_term term);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is currently an uninstantiated variable. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_is_number(ciao_term term);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is an integer (of any length) or a floating point number. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_is_integer(ciao_term term);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is instantiated to an integer. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_fits_in_int(ciao_term term);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is instantiated to an integer which can be stored in an @code{int}, and false otherwise. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_is_atom(ciao_term atom);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is an atom. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_is_list(ciao_term term);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is a list (actually, a @code{cons} cell). 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_is_empty_list(ciao_term term);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is the atom which represents the empty list (i.e., @code{[]}). 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_is_structure(ciao_term term);} 

Returns true if @code{term} is a structure of any arity. This includes atoms (i.e., structures of arity zero) and lists, but excludes variables and numbers.

@subsection Term navigation 

The functions below can be used to recover the value of a @code{ciao_term} into C variables, or to inspect Prolog structures. 
 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{int ciao_to_integer(ciao_term term); } 

Converts @code{term} to an integer. @code{ciao_is_integer(term)} must hold. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_to_integer_check(ciao_term term, int *result); } 

Checks whether @code{term} fits into the size of an integer. If so, true is returned and @code{*result} is unified with the integer @code{term} represents. Otherwise, false is returned and @code{*result} is not touched. 


@item @code{double ciao_to_float(ciao_term term);} 

Converts @code{term} to a float value. @code{ciao_is_number(term)} must hold. 


@item @code{char *ciao_get_number_chars(ciao_term term);} 

It converts @code{ciao_term} (which must be instantiated to a number) into a C string representing the number in the current radix. The string returned is a copy, which must (eventually) be explicitly deallocated by the user C code using the operation @code{ciao_free()} 


@item @code{char *ciao_atom_name(ciao_term atom);} 

Returns the name of the atom. The returned string @emph{is the one internally used by Ciao Prolog}, and should not be deallocated, changed or altered in any form. The advantage of using it is that it is fast, as no data copying is needed. 


@item @code{char *ciao_atom_name_dup(ciao_term atom);} 

Obtains a @strong{copy} of the name of the atom. The string can be modified, and the programmer has the responsibility of deallocating it after being used. Due to the copy, it is slower than calling @code{char *ciao_atom_name()}. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_list_head(ciao_term term);} 

Extracts the head of the list @code{term}. Requires @code{term} to be a list. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_list_tail(ciao_term term);} 

Extracts the tail of the list @code{term}. Requires @code{term} to be a list. 


@item @code{char *ciao_structure_name(ciao_term term);} 

Extracts the name of the structure @code{term}. Requires @code{term} to be a structure. 


@item @code{int ciao_structure_arity(ciao_term term);} 

Extracts the arity of the structure @code{term}. 

Requires @code{term} to be a structure. 


@item @code{ciao_term ciao_structure_arg(ciao_term term, int n);} 

Extracts the @emph{nth} argument of the structure @code{term}. It behaves like @code{arg/3}, so the first argument has index 1. Requires @code{term} to be a structure.

@subsection Testing for Equality and Performing Unification 

Variables of type @code{ciao_term} cannot be tested directly for equality: they are (currently) implemented as a sort of pointers which may be aliased (two different pointers may refer to the same object). The interface provides helper functions for testing term equality and to perform unification of terms.

@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_unify(ciao_term x, ciao_term y);} 

Performs the unification of the terms @code{x} and @code{y}, and returns true if the unification was successful. This is equivalent to calling the (infix) Prolog predicate @code{=/2}. The bindings are trailed and undone on backtracking. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_equal(ciao_term x, ciao_term y);} 

Performs equality testing of terms, and returns true if the test was successful. This is equivalent to calling the (infix) Prolog predicate @code{==/2}. Equality testing does not modify the terms compared.

@subsection Raising Exceptions 

The following functions offers a way of throwing 
@glindex exceptions
exceptions from C that can be caught in Prolog with @code{catch/3}. The term that reaches Prolog is exactly the same which was thrown by C. The execution flow is broken at the point where @code{ciao_raise_exception()} is executed, and it returns to Prolog. 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{void ciao_raise_exception(ciao_term ball);} 

Raises an exception an throws the term @code{ball}.

@subsection Creating and disposing of memory chunks 

Memory to be used solely by the user C code can be reserved/disposed of using, e.g., the well-known @code{malloc()}/@code{free()} functions (or whatever other functions the user may have available). However, memory explicitly allocated by Ciao Prolog and passed to C code, or allocated by C code and passed on to Ciao Prolog (and subject to garbage collection by it) should be allotted and freed (when necessary) by using the functions: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{void *ciao_malloc(int size);} 


@item @code{void ciao_free(void *pointer);} 


@end itemize  


@noindent
whose behavior is similar to @code{malloc()}/@code{free()}, but which will cooordinate properly with Ciao Prolog's internal memory management.

@subsection Calling Prolog from C 

It is also possible to make arbitraty calls to Prolog predicates from C. There are two basic ways of make a query, depending on whether only one solution is needed (or if the predicate to be called is known to generate only one solution), or if several solutions are required. 

When only one solution is needed @code{ciao_commit_call} obtains it (the solution obtained will obviously be the first one) and discards the resources used for finding it: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_commit_call(char *name, int arity, ...);} 

Makes a call to a predicate and returns true or false depending on whether the query has succedeed or not. In case of success, the (possibly) instantiated variables are reachable from C. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_commit_call_term(ciao_term goal);} 

Like @code{ciao_commit_call()} but uses the previously built term @code{goal} as goal. 


@end itemize  

If more than one solution is needed, it is necessary to use the @code{ciao_query} operations. A consult begins with a @code{ciao_query_begin} which returns a @code{ciao_query} object. Whenever an additional solution is required, the @code{ciao_query_next} function can be called. The query ends by calling @code{ciao_query_end} and all pending search branches are pruned. 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{ciao_query *ciao_query_begin(char *name, int arity, ...);} 

The predicate with the given name, arity and arguments (similar to the @code{ciao_structure()} operation) is transformed into a @code{ciao_query} object which can be used to make the actual query. 


@item @code{ciao_query *ciao_query_begin_term(ciao_term goal);} 

Like ciao_query_begin but using the term @code{goal} instead. 


@item @code{ciao_bool ciao_query_ok(ciao_query *query);} 

Determines whether the query may have pending solutions. A false return value means that there are no more solutions; a true return value means that there are more possible solutions. 
 
@item @code{void ciao_query_next(ciao_query *query);} 

Ask for a new solution. 


@item @code{void ciao_query_end(ciao_query *query);} 

Ends the query and frees the used resources.

@subsection Mathematical functions 

In this example, the standard mathematical library is accessed to provide the @emph{sin}, @emph{cos}, and @emph{fabs} functions. Note that the library is specified simply as 


@smallexample 
:- use_foreign_library([m]).
@end smallexample  

The foreign interface adds the @code{-lm} at compile time. Note also how some additional options are added to optimize the compiled code (only glue code, in this case) and mathematics (only in the case of Linux in an Intel processor).

@subsection Lists of bytes and buffers 

A list of bytes (c.f., a list of ints) corresponds to a byte buffer in C. The length of the buffer is associated to that of the list using the property @code{size_of/2}. The returned buffer @strong{is freed by Ciao Prolog} upon its recepction, unless the @code{do_not_free/1} property is specified (see later). Conversely, a list of natural numbers in the range 0 to 255 can be passed to C as a buffer.

@subsection Strings and atoms 

A C string can be seen as a buffer whose end is denoted by the trailing zero, and therefore stating its length is not needed. Two translations are possible into Ciao Prolog: as a Prolog string (list of bytes, with no trailing zero) and as an atom. These are selected automatically just by choosing the corresponding type (look at the examples below). 

Note how the @code{do_not_free/1} property is specified in the 
@glindex a_string/1
@code{a_string/1} predicate: the string returned by C is static, and therefore it should not be freed by Prolog.

Unbound length integers (and, in general, any number) can be converted to/from @code{ciao_terms} by using strings.

This module provides two predicates which give the user information regarding how to compile external (C) files in order to link them with the Ciao Prolog engine at runtime. 

These predicates are not intended to be called directly by the end-user. Instead, a tool or module whose aim is generating dynamically loadable files from source files should use the predicates in this file in order to find out what are the proper compiler and linker to use, and which options must be passed to them in the current architecture.

Low-level utilities for building foreign interfaces. End-users should not need to use them, as the Ciao Prolog Compiler reads the user assertions and calls appropriately the predicates in this module.

This library allows connecting a Ciao Prolog application with daVinci V2.X. 

The communication is based on a two-way channel: after daVinci is started, messages are sent in to it and read in from it on demand by different Prolog predicates. Messages are sent via writing the term as text; messages are received by reading text and returning an atom. Commands sent and answers received are treated as terms from the Prolog side, since for daVinci they are text but have term syntax; the only difficulty lies in strings, for which special Prolog syntax is provided. 

See accompanying file @code{library('davinci/commands')} for examples on the use of this library. 

daVinci is developed by U. of Bremen, Germany.

The 
@glindex tcltk
@code{tcltk} library package is a bidirectional interface to the @emph{Tcl} language and the @emph{Tk} toolkit. Tcl is an interpreted scripting language with many extension packages, particularly the graphical interface toolkit, Tk. The interaction between both languages is expressed in terms of an interface between the Tcl/Tk process and the Prolog process. This approach allows the development of mixed applications where both sides, Tcl/Tk and Prolog, can be combined in order to exploit their respective capabilities. 

This library uses two sockets to connect both the Tcl and the Prolog processes: @emph{event_socket} and @emph{term_socket}. There are also two Tcl global variables: @emph{prolog_variables} and @emph{terms}. The value of any of the bound variables in a goal will be stored in the array @code{prolog_variables} with the variable name as index. @emph{Terms} is the string which contains the printed representation of prolog @emph{terms}. 
 


@noindent
@strong{Prolog to Tcl} 

The Tcl/Tk side waits for requests from the Prolog side, and executes the Tcl/Tk code received. Also, the Tcl/Tk side handles the events and exceptions which may be raised on its side, passing on control to the Prolog side in case it is necessary. 

To use Tcl, you must create a @emph{Tcl interpreter} object and send commands to it. A @emph{Tcl} command is specified as follows: 


@smallexample 
      Command         --> Atom  @{ other than [] @}
                        | Number
                        | chars(PrologString)
                        | write(Term)
                        | format(Fmt,Args)
                        | dq(Command)
                        | br(Command)
                        | sqb(Command)
                        | min(Command)
                        | ListOfCommands
      ListOfCommands  --> []
                        |[Command|ListOfCommands]
@end smallexample  

where: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{Atom} 
denotes the printed representation of the atom. 


@item @code{Number} 
denotes their printed representations. 


@item @code{chars(PrologString)} 
denotes the string represented by @emph{PrologString} (a list of character codes). 


@item @code{write(Term)} 
denotes the string that is printed by the corresponding built-in predicate. 


@item @code{format(Term)} 
denotes the string that is printed by the corresponding built-in predicate. 


@item @code{dq(Command)} 
denotes the string specified by @emph{Command}, enclosed in double quotes. 


@item @code{br(Command)} 
denotes the string specified by @emph{Command}, enclosed in braces. 


@item @code{sqb(Command)}

@item @code{min(Command)} 
denotes the string specified by @emph{Command}, immediately preceded by a hyphen. 


@item @code{ListOfCommands} 
denotes the strings denoted by each element, separated by spaces.

@end smallexample  
 
@noindent
@strong{Tcl to Prolog} 

This is the usual way to build a GUI application. The slave, Prolog, behaves as a server that fulfills eventual requests from the master side, Tcl. At some point, during the user interaction with the GUI, an action may take place that triggers the execution of some procedure on the slave side (a form submit, for example). Thus, the slave is invoked, performs a service, and returns the result to the GUI through the socket connection. 

This library includes two main specific Tcl commands: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{prolog} @emph{Goal} 
@emph{Goal} is a string containing the printed representation of a Prolog goal. The goal will be called in the user module unless it is prefixed with another module name. The call is always deterministic and its can be either of the following: 


@table @asis 


@item @emph{1}, in case of success 
The value of any of the variables in the goal that is bound to a term will be returned to Tcl in the array prolog_variables with the variable name as index. 


@item @emph{0}, if the execution fails 
The Prolog exception Tcl exception is raised. The error message will be "Prolog Exception: " appended with a string representation of such exception. 


@end table  


@item @code{prolog_event} @emph{Term} 
Adds the new @emph{term} to the @emph{terms} queue. These can be later retrieved through predicates 
@glindex tcl_event/3
@code{tcl_event/3} and 
@glindex tk_next_event/2
@code{tk_next_event/2}. 


@end table  

Additionally, seven extra Tcl commands are defined. 


@table @asis 


@item @code{prolog_delete_event} 
Deletes the first @emph{term} of the @emph{terms} queue. 


@item @code{prolog_list_events} 
Sends all the @emph{terms} of the @emph{terms} queue through the @emph{event_socket}. The last element is @emph{end_of_event_list}. 


@item @code{prolog_cmd} @emph{Command} 
Receives as an argument the Tcl/Tk code, evaluates it and returns through the @emph{term_socket} the term @emph{tcl_error} in case of error or the term @emph{tcl_result} with the result of the command executed. If the command is @emph{prolog}, upon return, the goal run on the prolog side is received. In order to get the value of the variables, predicates are compared using the @emph{unify_term} command. Returns 0 when the sript runs without errors, and 1 if there is an error. 


@item @code{prolog_one_event} @emph{Term} 
Receives as an argument the @emph{term} associated to one of the Tk events. Sends the @emph{term} through the @emph{event_socket} and waits for its unification. Then @emph{unify_term} command is called to update the @emph{prolog_variables} array. 


@item @code{prolog_thread_event} @emph{Term} 
Receives as an argument the @emph{term} associated to one of the Tk events. Sends the @emph{term} through the @emph{event_socket} and waits for its unification. Then @emph{unify_term} command is called to update the @emph{prolog_variables} array. In this case the @emph{term_socket} is non blocking. 


@item @code{convert_variables} @emph{String} 
Its argument is a string containing symbols that can not be sent through the sockets. This procedure deletes them from the input string and returns the new string. 


@item @code{unify_term} @emph{Term1} @emph{Term2} 
Unifies @emph{Term1} and @emph{Term2} and updates the the @emph{prolog_variables} array. 


@end table  

The predicates to use Prolog from Tcl are 
@glindex tk_event_loop/1
@code{tk_event_loop/1}, 
@glindex tk_main_loop/1
@code{tk_main_loop/1}, 
@glindex tk_new/2
@code{tk_new/2}, and 
@glindex tk_next_event/2
@code{tk_next_event/2}. 


@noindent
An example of use with Tcl as master and Prolog as slave, implementing the well known "Hello, world!" dummy program (more can be seen in directory examples): 

Prolog side: 


@noindent

@smallexample 
:- use_module(library(tcltk)).
:- use_package(classic).
     
hello('Hello, world!').
     
go :-
        tk_new([name('Simple')], Tcl),
        tcl_eval(Tcl, 'source simple.tcl', _),
        tk_main_loop(Tcl),
        tcl_delete(Tcl).

@end smallexample  

Tcl side (simple.tcl): 


@noindent

@smallexample 
label .l -textvariable tvar
button .b -text "Go!" -command @{run@}
pack .l .b -side top

proc run @{@} @{

    global prolog_variables

The 
@glindex tcltk_low_level
@code{tcltk_low_level} library defines the low level interface used by the 
@glindex tcltk
@code{tcltk} library. Essentially it includes all the code related directly to the handling of sockets and processes. This library should normally not be used directly by user programs, which use 
@glindex tcltk
@code{tcltk} instead. On the other hand in some cases it may be useful to undertand how this library works in order to understand possible problems in programs that use the 
@glindex tcltk
@code{tcltk} library.

This library implements an object-orented graphical library with a number of predefined objects, using the Prolog Tcl/Tk interface. This interface allows creating and destroying objects and modifying their properties. The 
@glindex window_class
@code{window_class} contains three clases: widget class, menu class, and canvas class. The constructor class is window_class.

This package implements the PiLLoW library [CHV96a]. The following three chapters document, respectively, the predicates for HTML/XML/CGI programming, the predicate for HTTP conectivity, and the types used in the definition of the predicates (key for fully understanding the other predicates). You can find a paper and some additional information in the 
@glindex library/pillow/doc
@code{library/pillow/doc} directory of the distribution, and in the WWW at @uref{http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/pillow/pillow.html}. There is also a

@emph{PiLLoW on-line tutorial} (slides) at @uref{http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/logalg/slides/C_pillow/C_pillow.html} which illustrates the basic features and provides a number of examples of PiLLoW use.

@section Installing PiLLoW 
 To correctly install PiLLoW, first, make sure you downloaded the right version of PiLLoW (there are different versions for different LP/CLP systems; the version that comes with Ciao is of course the right one for Ciao). Then, please follow these steps: 


@enumerate  


@item Copy the files in the @code{images} directory to a WWW accessible directory in your server. 


@item Edit the file 
@glindex icon_address.pl
@code{icon_address.pl} and change the fact to point to the URL to be used to access the images above. 


@item In the Ciao system the files are in the correct place, in other systems copy the files 
@glindex pillow.pl
@code{pillow.pl} and 
@glindex icon_address.pl
@code{icon_address.pl} to a suitable directory so that your Prolog system will find them. 


@end enumerate

@code{html_template(Chars, Terms, Dict)}


Interprets @code{Chars} as an HTML template returning in @code{Terms} the corresponding structured HTML-term, which includes variables, and unifying @code{Dict} with a dictionary of those variables (an incomplete list of @emph{name}@code{=}@emph{Var} pairs). An HTML template is standard HTML code, but in which ``slots'' can be defined and given an identifier. These slots represent parts of the HTML code in which other HTML code can be inserted, and are represented in the HTML-term as free variables. There are two kinds of variables in templates: 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Variables representing page contents. A variable with name @emph{name} is defined with the special tag @code{<V>}@emph{name}@code{</V>}. 


@item Variables representing tag attributes. They occur as an attribute or an attribute value starting with @code{_}, followed by its name, which must be formed by alphabetic characters. 


@end itemize  

As an example, suposse the following HTML template: 
@smallexample 
<html>
<body bgcolor=_bgcolor>
<v>content</v>
</body>
</html>

@end smallexample  
The following query in the Ciao toplevel shows how the template is parsed, and the dictionary returned: 
@smallexample 
?- file_to_string('template.html',_S), html_template(_S,Terms,Dict). 

Dict = [bgcolor=_A,content=_B|_],
Terms = [env(html,[],["
",env(body,[bgcolor=_A],["
",_B,"
"]),"
"]),"
"] ? 

yes
@end smallexample  
If a dictionary with values is supplied at call time, then variables are unified accordingly inside the template: 
@smallexample 
?- file_to_string('template.html',_S),
   html_template(_S,Terms,[content=b("hello world!"),bgcolor="white"]). 

Terms = [env(html,[],["
",env(body,[bgcolor="white"],["

"]),"

A term which represents HTML or XML code in a structured way. In addition to the structures defined by 
@glindex canonic_html_term/1
@code{canonic_html_term/1} or 
@glindex canonic_xml_term/1
@code{canonic_xml_term/1}, the following structures can be used: 
@table @asis 


@item @strong{begin(}@emph{tag}@strong{,}@emph{atts}@strong{)} 
It translates to the start of an HTML environment of name @emph{tag} and attributes @emph{atts}. There exists also a @strong{begin(@emph{tag})} structure. Useful, in conjunction with the next structure, when including in a document output generated by an existing piece of code (e.g. @emph{tag} = @code{pre}). Its use is otherwise discouraged. 


@item @strong{end(}@emph{tag}@strong{)} 
Translates to the end of an HTML environment of name @emph{tag}. 


@item @strong{start} 
Used at the beginning of a document (translates to @code{<html>}). 


@item @strong{end} 
Used at the end of a document (translates to @code{</html>}). 


@item @code{--} 
Produces a horizontal rule (translates to @code{<hr>}). 


@item @strong{\\} 
Produces a line break (translates to @code{<br>}). 


@item @strong{$} 
Produces a paragraph break (translates to @code{<p>}). 


@item @strong{image(}@emph{address}@strong{)}

@item @strong{ref(}@emph{address}@strong{,}@emph{text}@strong{)} 
Produces a hypertext link, @emph{address} is the URL of the referenced resource, @emph{text} is the text of the reference (equivalent to @code{a([href=}@emph{address}@code{],}@emph{text}@code{)}). 


@item @strong{label(}@emph{name}@strong{,}@emph{text}@strong{)} 
Labels @emph{text} as a target destination with label @emph{name} (equivalent to @code{a([name=}@emph{name}@code{],}@emph{text}@code{)}). 


@item @strong{heading(}@emph{n}@strong{,}@emph{text}@strong{)} 
Produces a heading of level @emph{n} (between 1 and 6), @emph{text} is the text to be used as heading. Useful when one wants a heading level relative to another heading (equivalent to @code{h}@emph{n}@code{(}@emph{text}@code{)}). 


@item @strong{itemize(}@emph{items}@strong{)} 
Produces a list of bulleted items, @emph{items} is a list of corresponding HTML terms (translates to a @code{<ul>} environment).

@item @strong{nice_itemize(}@emph{img}@strong{,}@emph{items}@strong{)} 
Produces a list of bulleted items, using the image @emph{img} as bullet. The predicate 
@glindex icon_address/2
@code{icon_address/2} provides a colored bullet. 


@item @strong{preformatted(}@emph{text}@strong{)} 
Used to include preformatted text, @emph{text} is a list of HTML terms, each element of the list being a line of the resulting document (translates to a @code{<pre>} environment).

@item @strong{pr} 
Includes in the page a graphical logo with the message ``Developed using the PiLLoW Web programming library'', which points to the manual and library source. 


@item @emph{name}@strong{(}@emph{text}@strong{)}

@smallexample 
   address('clip@@clip.dia.fi.upm.es')
   @end smallexample  
is translated into the HTML source 
@smallexample 
   <address>clip@@clip.dia.fi.upm.es</address>
   @end smallexample  


@item @emph{name}@strong{(}@emph{atts}@strong{,}@emph{text}@strong{)} 
A term with functor @emph{name}/2, different from the special functors defined herein, represents an HTML environment of name @emph{name}, attributes @emph{atts} and included text @emph{text}. For example, the term 
@smallexample 

   a([href='http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/'],"Clip home")

@section Introduction to persistent predicates 

This library implements a @emph{generic persistent predicate database}. The basic notion implemented by the library is that of a 
@glindex persistent predicate
persistent predicate. The persistent predicate concept provides a simple, yet powerful generic persistent data access method [CHGT98,Par97]. A persistent predicate is a special kind of dynamic, data predicate that ``resides'' in some persistent medium (such as a set of files, a database, etc.) that is typically external to the program using such predicates. The main effect is that any changes made to to a persistent predicate from a program ``survive'' across executions. I.e., if the program is halted and restarted the predicate that the new process sees is in precisely the same state as it was when the old process was halted (provided no change was made in the meantime to the storage by other processes or the user). 

Persistent predicates appear to a program as ordinary predicates, and calls to these predicates can appear in clause bodies in the usual way. However, the definitions of these predicates do not appear in the program. Instead, the library maintains automatically the definitions of predicates which have been declared as persistent in the persistent storage. 


@glindex Updates to persistent predicates
Updates to persistent predicates can be made using enhanced versions of 
@glindex asserta_fact/1
@code{asserta_fact/1}, 
@glindex assertz_fact/1
@code{assertz_fact/1} and 
@glindex retract_fact/1
@code{retract_fact/1}. The library makes sure that each update is a 
@glindex transactional update
transactional update, in the sense that if the update terminates, then the permanent storage has definitely been modified. For example, if the program making the updates is halted just after the update and then restarted, then the updated state of the predicate will be seen. This provides security against possible data loss due to, for example, a system crash. Also, due to the atomicity of the transactions, persistent predicates allow 
@glindex concurrent updates
concurrent updates from several programs. 



@node Persistent predicates, Using file-based persistent predicates, Introduction to persistent predicates, Persistent predicate database

@section Persistent predicates, files, and relational databases 

The concept of persistent predicates provided by this library essentially implements a light-weight, simple, and at the same time powerful form of relational database (a 
@glindex deductive database
deductive database), and which is standalone, in the sense that it does not require external support, other than the file management capabilities provided by the operating system. This is due to the fact that the persistent predicates are in fact stored in one or more auxiliary files below a given directory. 

This type of database is specially useful when building small to medium-sized standalone applications in Prolog which require persistent storage. In many cases it provides a much easier way of implementing such storage than using files under direct program control. For example, interactive applications can use persistent predicates to represent their internal state in a way that is close to the application. The persistence of such predicates then allows automatically restoring the state to that at the end of a previous session. Using persistent predicates amounts to simply declaring some predicates as such and eliminates having to worry about opening files, closing them, recovering from system crashes, etc. 

In other cases, however, it may be convenient to use a relational database as persistent storage. This may be the case, for example, when the data already resides in such a database (where it is perhaps accessed also by other applications) or the volume of data is very large. 
@glindex persdb_sql
@code{persdb_sql} [CCG98] is a companion library which implements the same notion of persistent predicates used herein, but keeping the storage in a relational database. This provides a very natural and transparent way to access SQL database relations from a Prolog program. In that library, facilities are also provided for reflecting more complex @emph{views} of the database relations as predicates. Such views can be constructed as conjunctions, disjunctions, projections, etc. of database relations, and may include SQL-like aggregation operations. 

A nice characteristic of the notion of persistent predicates used in both of these libraries is that it abstracts away how the predicate is actually stored. Thus, a program can use persistent predicates stored in files or in external relational databases interchangeably, and the type of storage used for a given predicate can be changed without having to modify the program (except for replacing the corresponding 
@glindex persistent/2
@code{persistent/2} declarations). 

An example application of the 
@glindex persdb
@code{persdb} and 
@glindex persdb_sql
@code{persdb_sql} libraries (and also the 
@glindex pillow
@code{pillow} library [CH97]), is 
@glindex WebDB
@code{WebDB} [GCH98]. 
@glindex WebDB
@code{WebDB} is a generic, highly customizable @emph{deductive database engine} with an @emph{html interface}. 
@glindex WebDB
@code{WebDB} allows creating and maintaining Prolog-based databases as well as relational databases (residing in conventional relational database engines) using any standard WWW browser.

@section Using file-based persistent predicates 

Persistent predicates can be declared statically, using 
@glindex persistent/2
@code{persistent/2} declarations (which is the preferred method, when possible), or dynamically via calls to 
@glindex make_persistent/2
@code{make_persistent/2}. Currently, persistent predicates may only contain facts, i.e., they are @emph{dynamic} predicates of type 
@glindex data/1
@code{data/1}. 

Predicates declared as persistent are linked to directory, and the persistent state of the predicate will be kept in several files below that directory. The files in which the persistent predicates are stored are in readable, plain ASCII format, and in Prolog syntax. One advantage of this approach is that such files can also be created or edited by hand, in a text editor, or even by other applications. 

An example definition of a persistent predicate implemented by files follows: 


@smallexample 
:- persistent(p/3,dbdir).

persistent_dir(dbdir, '/home/clip/public_html/db').
@end smallexample  

The first line declares the predicate @code{p/3} persistent. The argument @code{dbdir} is a key used to index into a fact of the relation 
@glindex persistent_dir/2
@code{persistent_dir/2}, which specifies the directory where the corresponding files will be kept. The effect of the declaration, together with the 
@glindex persistent_dir/2
@code{persistent_dir/2} fact, is that, although the predicate is handled in the same way as a normal data predicate, in addition the system will create and maintain efficiently a persistent version of @code{p/3} via files in the directory @code{/home/clip/public_html/db}. 

The level of indirection provided by the @code{dbdir} argument makes it easy to place the storage of several persistent predicates in a common directory, by specifying the same key for all of them. It also allows changing the directory for several such persistent predicates by modifying only one fact in the program. Furthermore, the 
@glindex persistent_dir/2
@code{persistent_dir/2} predicate can even be dynamic and specified at run-time.

updated state the facts (tuples) that define the predicate are stored in the data file and the operations file is empty (the backup file, which contains a security copy of the data file, may or may not exist). 

While a program using a persistent predicate is running, any insertion (assert) or deletion (retract) operations on the predicate are performed on both the program memory and on the persistence set. However, in order to incurr only a small overhead in the execution, rather than changing the data file directly, a record of each of the insertion and deletion operations is @emph{appended} to the operations file. The predicate is then in a 
@glindex transient state
transient state, in that the contents of the data file do not reflect exactly the current state of the corresponding predicate. However, the complete persistence set does. 

When a program starts, all pending operations in the operations file are performed on the data file. A backup of the data file is created first to prevent data loss if the system crashes during this operation. The order in which this updating of files is done ensures that, if at any point the process dies, on restart the data will be completely recovered. This process of updating the persistence set can also be triggered at any point in the execution of the program (for example, when halting) by calling 
@glindex update_files
@code{update_files}.

@section Defining an initial database 

It is possible to define an initial database by simply including in the program code facts of persistent predicates. They will be included in the persistent database when it is created. They are ignored in successive executions.

@section Using persistent predicates from the top level 

Special care must be taken when loading into the top level modules or user files which use persistent predicates. Beforehand, a goal @code{use_module(library('persdb/persdbrt'))} must be issued. Furthermore, since persistent predicates defined by the loaded files are in this way defined dynamically, a call to 
@glindex initialize_db/0
@code{initialize_db/0} is commonly needed after loading and before calling predicates of these files.

@item @strong{Library usage:}

There are two packages which implement persistence: 
@glindex persdb
@code{persdb} and 
@glindex 'persdb/ll'
@code{'persdb/ll'} (for low level). In the first, the standard builtins 
@glindex asserta_fact/1
@code{asserta_fact/1}, 
@glindex assertz_fact/1
@code{assertz_fact/1}, and 
@glindex retract_fact/1
@code{retract_fact/1} are replaced by new versions which handle persistent data predicates, behaving as usual for normal data predicates. In the second package, predicates with names starting with @code{p} are defined, so that there is no overhead in calling the standard builtins. In any case, each package is used as usual: including it in the package list of the module, or using the 
@glindex use_package/1
@code{use_package/1} declaration.

This package allows using files as a ``
@glindex cache
cache'' for predicates defined by facts. This is useful for huge tables of facts that may push the memory limits of the system too far. Goals of a 
@glindex filed predicate
filed predicate are executed simply by reading from the corresponding file. 

Anything in the DB file used for the predicate that is different from a fact for the corresponding predicate is ignored. Each call to a filed predicate forces opening the file, so the use of this package is subject to the limit on the number of open files that the system can support. 

Dynamic modification of the filed predicates is also allowed during execution of the program. Thus filed predicates are regarded as dynamic, data predicates residing in a file. However, dynamic modifications to the predicates do not affect the file, unless the predicate is also declared persistent. 

The package is compatible with 
@glindex persdb
@code{persdb} in the sense that a predicate can be made both filed and persistent. In this way, the predicate can be used in programs, but it will not be loaded (saving memory), can also be modified during execution, and modifications will persist in the file. Thus, the user interface to both packages is the same (so the DB file must be one for both filing and persistency).

The DB files for persistent predicates have to be used as such from the beginning. Using a DB file for a filed predicate first, and then using it also when making the predicate persistent won't work. Nor the other way around: using a DB file for a persistent predicate first, and then using it also when making the predicate filed.

The purpose of this library is to implement an instance of the generic concept of 
@glindex persistent predicates
persistent predicates, where external 
@glindex relational databases
relational databases are used for storage (see the documentation of the 
@glindex persdb
@code{persdb} library and [CHGT98,Par97] for details). To this end, this library exports SQL persistent versions of the 
@glindex assertz_fact/1
@code{assertz_fact/1}, 
@glindex retract_fact/1
@code{retract_fact/1} and 
@glindex retractall_fact/1
@code{retractall_fact/1} builtin predicates. Persistent predicates also allow 
@glindex concurrent updates
concurrent updates from several programs, since each update is atomic. 

The notion of persistence provides a very natural and transparent way to access database relations from a Prolog program. Stub definitions are provided for such predicates which access the database when the predicate is called (using the 
@glindex db_client
@code{db_client} library). A 
@glindex Prolog to SQL translator
Prolog to SQL translator is used to generate the required 
@glindex SQL
SQL code dynamically (see library 
@glindex pl2sql
@code{pl2sql}). 

This library also provides facilities for reflecting more complex 
@glindex views
views of the database relations as Prolog predicates. Such views can be constructed as conjunctions, disjunctions, projections, etc. of database relations. Also, 
@glindex SQL
SQL-like 
@glindex aggregation operations
aggregation operations are supported.

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Implementation of the Database Interface 

The architecture of the low-level implementation of the database interface was defined with two goals in mind: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item to simplify the communication between the Prolog system and the relational database engines as much as possible, and 


@item to give as much flexibility as possible to the overall system. This includes simultaneous access to several databases, allowing both the databases and clients to reside on the same physical machine or different machines, and allowing the clients to reside in Win95/NT or Unix machines. 
@end itemize  
 
In order to allow the flexibility mentioned above, a client-sever architecture was chosen. At the server side, a MySQL server connects to the databases using the MySQL. At the client side, a MySQL client interface connects to this server. The server daemon (mysqld) should be running in the server machine; check your MySQL documentation on how to do that. 

After the connection is established a client can send commands to the mediator server which will pass them to the corresponding database server, and then the data will traverse in the opposite direction. These messages include logging on and off from the database, sending SQL queries, and receiving the responses. 

The low level implementation of the current library is accomplished by providing abstraction levels over the MySQL interface library. These layers of abstraction implement the persistent predicate view, build the appropriate commands for the database using a translator of Prolog goals to SQL commands, issue such commands using the mediator send/receive procedures, parse the responses, and present such responses to the Prolog engine via backtracking.

attributes in the database corresponding respectively to the predicate name and arguments of the (virtual) Prolog predicate. 

Although a predicate may be persistent, other usual clauses can be defined in the source code.

@strong{Author(s):} C. Draxler. Adapted by M. Hermenegildo and I. Caballero.

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#112 (2003/11/27, 20:54:19 CET)

This library performs translation of Prolog queries into 
@glindex SQL
SQL. The code is an adaptation for Ciao of the 
@glindex Prolog to SQL compiler
Prolog to SQL compiler written by Christoph Draxler, CIS Centre for Information and Speech Processing, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, @code{draxler@@cis.uni-muenchen.de}, Version 1.1. Many thanks to Christoph for allowing us to include this adaptation of his code with Ciao. 

The translator needs to know the correspondence between Prolog predicates and the 
@glindex SQL tables
SQL tables in the database. To this end this module exports two multifile predicates, 
@glindex sql__relation/3
@code{sql__relation/3} and 
@glindex sql__attribute/4
@code{sql__attribute/4}. See the description of these predicates for details on how such correspondance is specified. 

The main entry points to the translator are 
@glindex pl2sqlstring/3
@code{pl2sqlstring/3} and 
@glindex pl2sqlterm/3
@code{pl2sqlterm/3}. Details on the types of queries allowed can be found in the description of these predicates. 

@strong{Example:} the following program would print out a term representing the SQL query corresponding to the given Prolog query: 


@smallexample 
%jcf%:- use_module(library('persdb_sql/pl2sql')).
:- use_module(library('persdb_mysql/pl2sql')).
%jcf%
:- use_module(library(strings)).

:- multifile [relation/3,attribute/4].
:- data [relation/3,attribute/4].

relation(product,3,'PRODUCT').
attribute(1,'PRODUCT','ID',int).
attribute(2,'PRODUCT','QUANTITY',int).
attribute(3,'PRODUCT','NAME',string).

main :- 
     pl2sqlstring( f(L,K), 
          ((product(L,N,a); product(L,N,b)),
           \+ product(2,3,b), 
           L + 2 > avg(Y, Z^product(Z,Y,a)),
           K is N + max(X, product(X,2,b))
           ), T),
     write_string(T).
     
%%     printqueries(T).

@end smallexample  

@strong{Note:} while the translator can be used directly in programs, it is more convenient to use a higher-level abstraction: 
@glindex persistent predicates
persistent predicates (implemented in the 
@glindex persdb
@code{persdb} library). The notion of persistent predicates provides a completely transparent interface between Prolog and relational databases. When using this library, the Prolog to SQL translation is called automatically as needed.

@code{DBGoal} is a goal meant to be executed in the external database. It can be a complex term containing 
@glindex conjunctions
conjunctions, 
@glindex disjunctions
disjunctions, and 
@glindex negations
negations, of: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item 
@glindex Atomic goals
Atomic goals, which must have been defined via 
@glindex sql__relation/3
@code{sql__relation/3} and 
@glindex sql__attribute/4
@code{sql__attribute/4} and reside in the (same) database. Their arguments must be either ground or free variables. If they are ground, they must be bound to constants of the type declared for that argument. If an argument is a free variable, it may @emph{share} with (i.e., be the same variable as) other free variables in other goal arguments. 


@item 
@glindex Database comparison goals
Database comparison goals, whose main functor must be a 
@glindex database comparison operator
database comparison operator (see 
@glindex pl2sql
@code{pl2sql}:
@glindex comparison/2
@code{comparison/2}) and whose arguments must be @emph{database arithmetic expressions}. 


@item 
@glindex Database calls to is/2
Database calls to is/2. The left side of such a call may be either unbound, in which case it is bound to the result of evaluating the right side, or bound in which case an equality condition is tested. The right side must be a @emph{database arithmetic expression}. 


@end itemize  

The binding of variables follows Prolog rules: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item variables are bound by positive base goals and on the left side of the 
@glindex is/2
@code{is/2} predicate. 


@item Comparison operations, negated goals, and right sides of the 
@glindex is/2
@code{is/2} predicate do not return variable bindings and may even require all arguments to be bound for a safe evaluation. 


@end itemize  


@glindex Database arithmetic expressions
Database arithmetic expressions may contain: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Numeric constants (i.e., integers, reals, etc.). 


@item Bound variables, i.e., variables which will be bound during execution through occurrence within a positive database goal, or by a preceding arithmetic function. 


@item 
@glindex Database arithmetic functions
Database arithmetic functions, which are a subset of those typically accepted within 
@glindex is/2
@code{is/2} (see 
@glindex pl2sql
@code{pl2sql}:
@glindex arithmetic_functor/2
@code{arithmetic_functor/2}). 


@item 
@glindex Database aggregation functions
Database aggregation functions, each of which has two arguments: a variable indicating the argument over which the function is to be computed, and a goal argument which must contain in at least one argument position the variable (e.g. @code{avg(Seats, plane(Type, Seats))}). The goal argument may only be a conjunction of (positive or negative) base goals. See 
@glindex pl2sql
@code{pl2sql}:
@glindex aggregate_functor/2
@code{aggregate_functor/2} for the admissible aggregate functions. 


@end itemize  

In addition, variables 
@coindex existential quantification
@glindex existential quantification 
can be existentially quantified using 
@glindex ^/2
@code{^/2} (in a similar way to how it is done in 
@glindex setof/3
@code{setof/3}). 

Note that it is assumed that the arithmetic operators in Prolog and SQL are the same, i.e., @code{+} is addition in Prolog and in SQL, etc.

This module defines the Ciao Prolog to Java interface. This interface allows a Prolog program to start a Java process, create Java objects, invoke methods, set/get attributes (fields), and handle Java events. 

This interface only works with JDK version 1.2 or higher. 

Although the Java side interface is explained in Javadoc format (it is available at @code{library/javall/javadoc/} in your Ciao installation), the general interface structure is detailed here.

@section Prolog to Java Interface Structure

@glindex Prolog to Java Interface Structure 
This interface is made up of two parts: a Prolog side and a Java side, running in separate processes. The Prolog side receives requests from a Prolog program and sends them to the Java side through a socket. The Java side receives requests from the socket and performs the actions included in the requests. 

If an event is thrown in the Java side, an asynchronous message must be sent away to the Prolog side, in order to launch a Prolog goal to handle the event. This asynchronous communication is performed using a separate socket. The nature of this communication needs the use of threads both in Java and Prolog: to deal with the 'sequential program flow,' and other threads for event handling. 

In both sides the threads are automatically created by the context of the objects we use. The user must be aware that different requests to the other side of the interface could run concurrently.

@coindex Prolog to Java Interface Structure. Prolog side
@glindex Prolog to Java Interface Structure. Prolog side 
The Prolog side receives the actions to do in the Java side from the user program, and sends them to the Java process through the socket connection. When the action is done in the Java side, the result is returned to the user Prolog program, or the action fails if there is any problem in the Java side. 

Prolog data representation of Java elements is very simple in this interface. Java primitive types such as integers and characters are translated into the Prolog corresponding terms, and even some Java objects are translated in the same way (e. g. Java strings). Java objects are represented in Prolog as compound terms with a reference id to identify the corresponding Java object. Data conversion is made automatically when the interface is used, so the Prolog user programs do not have to deal with the complexity of this tasks.

@subsection Java side 
@coindex Prolog to Java Interface Structure. Java side
@glindex Prolog to Java Interface Structure. Java side 
The Java side of this layer is more complex than the Prolog side. The tasks this part has to deal to are the following: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Wait for requests from the Prolog side. 


@item Translate the Prolog terms received in the Prolog 'serialized' form to a more useful Java representation (see the Java interface documentation available at @code{library/javall/javadoc/} in your Ciao installation for details regarding Java representation of Prolog terms). 


@item Interpret the requests received from the Prolog side, and execute them. 


@item Handle the set of objects created by or derived from the requests received from de prolog side. 


@item Handle the events raised in the Java side, and launch the listeners added in the prolog side. 


@item Handle the exceptions raised in the Java side, and send them to the Prolog side. 


@end itemize  

In the implementation of the Java side, two items must be carefully designed: the handling of Java objects, and the representation of prolog data structures. The last item is specially important because all the interactions between Prolog and Java are made using Prolog structures, an easy way to standardize the different data management in both sides. Even the requests themselves are encapsulated using Prolog structures. The overload of this encapsulation is not significant in terms of socket traffic, due to the optimal implementation of the prolog serialized term. 

The java side must handle the objects created from the Prolog side dinamically, and these objects must be accessed as fast as possible from the set of objects. The Java API provides a powerful implementation of Hash tables that achieves all the requirements of our implementation. 

On the other hand, the java representation of prolog terms is made using the inheritance of java classes. In the java side exists a representation of a generic prolog term, implemented as an abstract class in java. Variables, atoms, compound terms, lists, and numeric terms are classes in the java side which inherit from the term class. Java objects can be seen also under the prolog representation as compound terms, where the single argument corresponds to the Hash key of the actual java object in the Hash table referred to before. This behaviour makes the handling of mixed java and prolog elements easy. Prolog goals are represented in the java side as objects which contain a prolog compound term with the term representing the goal. This case will be seen more in depth next, when the java to prolog is explained.

@section Java event handling from Prolog 
@coindex Java event handling from Prolog
@glindex Java event handling from Prolog 
Java event handling is based on a delegation model since version 1.1.x. This approach to event handling is very powerful and elegant, but a user program cannot handle all the events that can arise on a given object: for each kind of event, a listener must be implemented and added specifically. However, the Java 2 API includes a special listener (@code{AWTEventListener}) that can manage the internal java event queue. 

The prolog to java interface has been designed to emulate the java event handler, and is also based on event objects and listeners. The prolog to java interface implements its own event manager, to handle those events that have prolog listeners associated to the object that raises the event. From the prolog side can be added listeners to objects for specific events. The java side includes a list of goals to launch from the object and event type. 

Due to the events nature, the event handler must work in a separate thread to manage the events asynchronously. The java side has its own mechanisms to work this way. The prolog side must be implemented specially for event handling using threads. The communication between java and prolog is also asynchronous, and an additional socket stream is used to avoid interferences with the main socket stream. The event stream will work in this implementation only in one way: from java to prolog. If an event handler needs to send back requests to java, it will use the main socket stream, just like the requests sent directly from a prolog program. 

The internal process of register a Prolog event handler to a Java event is shown in the next figure: 

@image{autofigip2jbn-events-pl-reg} 

When an event raises, the Prolog to Java interface has to send to the Prolog user program the goal to evaluate. Graphically, the complete process takes the tasks involved in the following figure:

@section Java exception handling from Prolog 
@coindex Java exception handling from Prolog
@glindex Java exception handling from Prolog 
Java exception handling is very similar to the peer prolog handling: it includes some specific statements to trap exceptions from user code. In the java side, the exceptions can be originated from an incorrect request, or can be originated in the code called from the request. Both exception types will be sent to prolog using the main socket stream, allowing the prolog program manage the exception. However, the first kind of exceptions are prefixed, so the user program can distinguish them from the second type of exceptions. 

In order to handle exceptions properly using the prolog to java and java to prolog interfaces simultaneously, in both sides of the interface will be filtered those exceptions coming from their own side: this avoids an endless loop of exceptions bouncing from one side to another.

@coindex Java to Prolog interface
@glindex Java to Prolog interface 
This module defines the Prolog side of the Java to Prolog interface. This side of the interface only has one public predicate: a server that listens at the socket connection with Java, and executes the commands received from the Java side. 

In order to evaluate the goals received from the Java side, this module can work in two ways: executing them in the same engine, or starting a thread for each goal. The easiest way is to launch them in the same engine, but the goals must be evaluated sequentially: once a goal provides the first solution, all the subsequent goals must be finished before this goal can backtrack to provide another solution. The Prolog side of this interface works as a top-level, and the goals partially evaluated are not independent. 

The solution of this goal dependence is to evaluate the goals in a different prolog engine. Although Ciao includes a mechanism to evaluate goals in different engines, the approach used in this interface is to launch each goal in a different thread. 

The decision of what kind of goal evaluation is selected is done by the Java side. Each evaluation type has its own command terms, so the Java side can choose the type it needs. 

A Prolog server starts by calling the @code{prolog_server/0} predicate, or by calling @code{prolog_server/1} predicate and providing the port number as argument. The user predicates and libraries to be called from Java must be included in the executable file, or be accesible using the built-in predicates dealing with code loading.

Reads from the standard input the node name and port number where the java client resides, and starts the prolog server listening at the jp socket. This predicate acts as a server: it includes an endless read-process loop until the @code{prolog_halt} command is received. 

However, from the low-level communication point of view, this Prolog server actually works as a client of the Java side. This means that Java side waits at the given port to a Prolog server trying to create a socket; Prolog side connects to that port, and then waits for Java requests (acting as a 'logical' server). To use this Prolog server as a real server waiting for connections at a given port, use @code{prolog_server/1}.

@item @emph{Description:} Waits for incoming Java connections to act as a Prolog goal server for Java requests.This is the only @code{prolog_server/*} predicate that works as a true server: given a port number, waits for a connection from Java and then serves Java requests. When a termination request is received, finishes the connection to Java and waits next Java connection request. This behaviour is different with respect to previous versions of this library. To work as before, use @code{prolog_server/2}. 

Although it currently does not support simultaneous Java connections, some work is being done in that direction.

@strong{Author(s):} The CLIP Group.

@strong{Version:} 1.9#342 (2004/4/24, 20:30:39 CEST)

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.9#234 (2003/12/22, 18:14:10 CET)

This library provides a 
@coindex prolog-emacs interface
@glindex prolog-emacs interface
@emph{prolog-emacs interface}. This interface is complementary to (and independent from) the 
@glindex emacs mode
emacs mode, which is used to develop programs from within the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/environment. Instead, this library allows calling 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} from a running Prolog program. This facilitates the use of 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} as a ``user interface'' for a Prolog program. Emacs can be made to: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Visit a file, which can then be edited. 


@item Execute arbitrary 
@coindex emacs lisp
@glindex emacs lisp
@emph{emacs lisp} code, sent from Prolog. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
In order for this library to work correctly, the following is needed: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item You should be running the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor on the same machine where the executable calling this library is executing. 


@item This 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} should be running the 
@coindex emacs server
@glindex emacs server
@emph{emacs server}. This can be done by including the following line in your 
@glindex .emacs
@code{.emacs} file: 


@smallexample    
;; Start a server that emacsclient can connect to.
(server-start)
@end smallexample  


@noindent
Or typing @code{M-x server-start} within 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
This suffices for using 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} to edit files. For running arbitrary code the following also needs to be added to the 
@glindex .emacs
@code{.emacs} file: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{(setq enable-local-eval t)} 
Allows executing lisp code without asking. 


@item @code{(setq enable-local-eval nil)} 
Does not allow executing lisp code without asking. 


@item @code{(setq enable-local-eval 'maybe)} 
Allows executing lisp code only if user agrees after asking (asks interactively for every invocation). 


@end table  


@noindent
@strong{Examples:} 


@noindent
Assuming that a @code{.pl} file loads this library, then: 


@table @asis 


@item @code{..., emacs_edit('foo'), ...} 
Opens file @code{foo} for editing in 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}. 


@item @code{..., emacs_eval_nowait("(run-ciao-toplevel)"), ...} 
Starts execution of a Ciao top-level within 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}.

@item * 
Matches any string, including the null string. 
@item ? 
Matches any single character. 
@item [...] 
Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated by a minus sign denotes a range; any character lexically between those two characters, inclusive, is matched. If the first character following the [ is a ^ then any character not enclosed is matched. No other character is special inside this construct. To include a ] in a character set, you must make it the first character. To include a `-', you must use it in a context where it cannot possibly indicate a range: that is, as the first character, or immediately after a range. 
@item | 
Specifies an alternative. Two patterns A and B with | in between form an expression that matches anything that either A or B will match. 
@item @{...@} 
Groups alternatives inside larger patterns. 
@item \ 
Quotes a special character (including itself).

A directed graph is a term @code{graph(V,E)} where @code{V} is a list of vertices and @code{E} is a list of edges (none necessarily sorted). Edges are pairs of vertices which are directed, i.e., @code{(a,b)} represents @code{a->b}. Two vertices @code{a} and @code{b} are equal only if @code{a==b}.

An unweighted directed graph (ugraph) is represented as a list of (vertex-neighbors) pairs, where the pairs are in standard order (as produced by keysort with unique keys) and the neighbors of each vertex are also in standard order (as produced by sort), and every neighbor appears as a vertex even if it has no neighbors itself. 

An undirected graph is represented as a directed graph where for each edge @code{(U,V)} there is a symmetric edge @code{(V,U)}. 

An edge @code{(U,V)} is represented as the term @code{U-V}. 

A vertex can be any term. Two vertices are distinct iff they are not identical (
@glindex ==/2
@code{==/2}). 

A path is represented as a list of vertices. No vertex can appear twice in a path.

This one is a copy of the same procedure in library(wgraphs) except for the definition of min/3 (ah! - the polimorphism!). 

It would only be needed if there are multi-edges, i.e., several edges between the same two vertices.

cleandirs [--silent] <initial_dir> <delete_options> <backup_options>
cleandirs explores <initial_dir> (which should be an absolute path)
and looks for backup files and files which can be generated from other
files, using a plausible heuristic aimed at retaining the same amount
of information while recovering some disk space.  The heuristic is
based on the extension of the filename.

Delete options is one of:
   --list: just list the files/directories which are amenable to be deleted,
           but do not delete them. SAFE.
    --ask: list the files/directories and ask for deletion. UNSAFE if you
           make a mistake.
 --delete: just delete the files/directories without asking.  I envy your
           brave soul if you choose this option.

Backup options is one of:
 --includebackups: include backup files in the list of files to check.
 --excludebackups: do not include backup files in the list of files to check.
    --onlybackups: include only backup files in the list of files to check.

Symbolic links are not traversed.  Special files are not checked.


   @end smallexample  
 
Invoking the program with no arguments will return an up-to-date information on the options.

The @code{xrefs} crossed-references Ciao library includes several modules which allow displaying crossed-references of the code in a program. Crossed-references identify modules which import code from other modules, or files (be them modules or not) which use code in other files. Crossed-references can be obtained as a term representing a graph, displayed graphically (using daVinci, a graph displayer developed by U. of Bremen, Germany), or printed as a list. 

The libraries involved are as follows: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item 
@glindex etc(xmrefs)
@code{etc(xmrefs)} displays a graph of crossed-references between modules using daVinci, 
@item 
@glindex etc(xfrefs)

@item

@item 
@glindex library('xrefs/mrefs')
@code{library('xrefs/mrefs')} obtains a graph of crossed-references between modules, 
@item 
@glindex library('xrefs/pxrefs')
@code{library('xrefs/pxrefs')} prints a list of crossed-references between files. 
@end itemize  
The first two are intended to be used by loading in 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}. The other three are intended to be used as modules within an application. 

The following is an example graph of the library modules involved in the crossed-references application. It has been obtained with:

@coindex lpmake
@glindex lpmake 

@strong{Note:} 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} and the 
@glindex make
@code{make} library are still under development, and they may change in future releases. 


@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} is a Ciao application which uses the Ciao 
@glindex make
@code{make} library to implement a dependency-driven scripts in a similar way to the Un*x 
@glindex make
@code{make} facility. 

The original purpose of the Un*x 
@glindex make
@code{make} utility is to determine automatically which pieces of a large program needed to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. In practice, 
@glindex make
@code{make} is often used for many other purposes: it can be used to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever these change. 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} can be used for the same types of applications as 
@glindex make
@code{make}, and also for some new ones, and, while being simpler, it offers a number of advantages over 
@glindex make
@code{make}. The first one is @emph{portability}. When compiled to a bytecode executable 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} runs on any platform where a Ciao engine is available. Also, the fact that typically many of the operations are programmed in Prolog within the makefile, not needing external applications, improves portability further. The second advantage of 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} is @emph{improved programming capabilities}. While 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} is simpler than 
@glindex make
@code{make}, 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} allows using the Ciao Prolog language within the scripts. This allows establising more complex dependencies and programming powerful operations within the make file, and without resorting to external packages (e.g., operating system commands), which also helps portability. A final advantage of 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} is that it supports a form of @emph{autodocumentation}: 
@coindex lpmake autodocumentation
@glindex lpmake autodocumentation 
comments associated to targets can be included in the configuration files. Calling 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} in a directory which has such a configuration file explains what commands the configuration file support and what these commands will do.

@section General operation 

To prepare to use 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake}, and in a similar way to 
@glindex make
@code{make}, you must write a 
@coindex configuration file
@glindex configuration file
@emph{configuration file}: a module (typically called 
@glindex Makefile.pl
@code{Makefile.pl}) that describes the relationships among files in your program or application, and states the commands for updating each file. In a program, typically the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files. Another example is running 
@glindex latex
@code{latex} and 
@glindex dvips
@code{dvips} on a set of source @code{.tex} files to generate a document in @code{dvi} and @code{postscript} formats. Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, simply typing @code{lpmake} suffices to perform all necessary operations (recompilations, processing text files, etc.). The 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} program uses the dependency rules in the makefile and the last modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile. For example, in the 
@glindex latex
@code{latex}/
@glindex dvips
@code{dvips} case one rule states that the @code{.dvi} file whould be updated from the @code{.tex} files whenever one of them changes and another rule states that the @code{.ps} file needs to be updated from a @code{.dvi} file every time it changes. The rules also describe the commands to be issued to update the files. 

So, the general process is as follows: 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} executes commands in the configuration file to update one or more target @emph{names}, where @emph{name} is often a program, but can also be a file to be generated or even a ``virtual'' target. 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been modified since the target was last modified, or if the target does not exist. You can provide command line arguments to 
@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} to control which files should be regenerated, or how.

@section Format of the Configuration File 


@glindex lpmake
@code{lpmake} uses as default configuration file the file 
@glindex Makefile.pl
@code{Makefile.pl}, if it is present in the current directory. This can be overridden and another file used by means of the @code{-m} option. The configuration file must a @emph{module} that uses the 
@glindex make
@code{make} package. This package provides syntax for defining the dependency rules and functionality for correctly interpreting these rules. The configuration files can contain such rules and also arbitrary Ciao Prolog predicates. The syntax of the rules is described in @ref{The Ciao Make Package}, together with some examples.

@smallexample 


Supported command line options:

lpmake [-v] <command1> ... <commandn>

  Process commands <command1> ... <commandn>, using 
  file 'Makefile.pl' in the current directory as 
  configuration file. The configuration file must 
  be a module. This is useful to implement 
  inherintance across diferent configuration files, 
  i.e., the values declared in a configuration file 
  can be easily made to override those defined in 
  another.

  The optional argument '-v' produces verbose output, 
  reporting on the processing of the dependency rules. 
  Very useful for debugging Makefiles.

lpmake [-v] [-m <.../Configfile.pl>] <command1> ... <commandn>

  Same as above, but using file <.../Configfile.pl> 
  as configuration file. 

lpmake -h     [ -m <.../Configfile.pl> ]
lpmake -help  [ -m <.../Configfile.pl> ]

  Print this help message. If a configuration file is given, 
  and the commands in it are commented, then information on 
  these commands is also printed.

@strong{Version of last change:} 1.5#59 (2000/2/29, 14:51:54 CET)

MYCIN databases are declared as Prolog modules containing mycin rules. Those rules are given a 
@coindex certainty factor
@glindex certainty factor
@emph{certainty factor} (@emph{CF}) which denotates an expert's credibility on that rule: 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item A value of -1 stands for @emph{surely not}. 


@item A value of 1 stands for @emph{certainly}. 


@item A value of 0 stands for @emph{I don't know}. 


@end itemize  

Intermediate values are allowed. 

Mycin rules work on a different way as Prolog clauses: a rule will never fail (in the Prolog sense), it will return a certainty value instead. As a consequence @strong{all} mycin rules will be explored during inference, so the order in which rules are written is not significant. For this reason, the usage of the Prolog @emph{cut} (!) is discouraged.

This directive allows a given mycin predicate to be called from Prolog programs. The way in which mycin rules are called departs from Prolog ones. For instance, the followin mycin predicate: 
@smallexample 
:- export p/1.
@end smallexample  

must be called from Prolog Programs as: @code{mycin(p(X),CF)}, where CF will be binded to the resulting 
@glindex certainty factor
certainty factor. Obviously, the variables on @emph{P/1} may be instantiated as you wish. Since the Prolog predicate @emph{mycin/2} may be imported from several mycin databases, it is recommended to fully qualify those predicate goals. For example : @code{mydatabase:mycin(p(X),CF)}. 


@strong{Usage:} :- @code{export(Spec)}.

This package allows to write and evaluate constraint programming expressions over finite domains in a Ciao program. It is based upon the indexicals concept. 

The syntax of this constraint system is described below: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @emph{c ::= X in r} (@emph{r} is the range of variable @emph{X}). 
@item @emph{c ::= E1 .=. E2} (eventual value of expression @emph{E1} equals @emph{E2}) 
@item @emph{c ::= E1 .<>. E2} (@emph{E1} differs from @emph{E2}) 
@item @emph{c ::= E1 .<. E2} (@emph{E1} is lower than @emph{E2}) 
@item @emph{c ::= E1 .>. E2} (@emph{E1} is greater than @emph{E2}) 
@item @emph{c ::= E1 .=<. E2} (@emph{E1} is lower or equal than @emph{E2}) 
@item @emph{c ::= E1 .>=. E2} (@emph{E1} is greater or equal than @emph{E2}) 


@item @emph{r ::= r1} (one interval range). 
@item @emph{r ::= r1 .&. r} (multi interval range). 
@item @emph{r1 ::= t..t} (interval range). 
@item @emph{r1 ::= dom(X)} (indexical domain, e.g., @emph{X in dom(Y)} means @emph{"X in the domain of Y"}). 
@item @emph{t::= n} (integer). 
@item @emph{t::= min(X)} (indexical min). 
@item @emph{t::= max(X)} (indexical max). 
@end itemize

This library offers facilities to enable users to setup preferences on the values an eventual XML document may take. XML documents are specified by XDR documents (eXternal Data Representation standard), in a way conceptually similar to that of objects and classes in object oriented programming. These facilities allow to take as input an XDR Schema defining the class of documents of interest, and establish a dialogue with the user via an HTML form that allows the user to setup preferences to select sub-classes of documents (those which satisfy the preferences). The preferences are the output of the process and may be in the form of XPath expressions, for example, as can be seen in the example attached in the "examples" directory.

@strong{Version:} 0.1 (2003/12/1, 13:24:9 CET)

This package provides a language suitable for querying XML documents from a Prolog program. Constraint programming expresions can be included in order to prune search as soon as possible, i.e. upon constraint unsatisfability, improving efficiency. Also, facilities are offerd to improve search speed by transforming XML documents into Prolog programs, hence reducing search to just running the program and taking advantage of Prolog's indexing capabilities. 

Queries in an XML document have a recursive tree structructure that permits to detail the search on the XML element sought, its attributes, and its children. As a suffix, a constraint programming expression can be added. Queries return value for the free variables included (in case of success), and checks whether the XML document structure matches that depicted by the query itself. 

The operators introduced are described below: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
 
@item @emph{@@} Delimits a subquery on an elment's attribute, such as @code{product@@val(product_name, "car")}, the first argument being the attribute name and the second its value. Any of them can be free variables, being possible to write queries like @code{product@@val(Name, "car")}, intended to find the 'Name' of attributes of element product whose value is the string "car". 


@item @emph{::} The right-hand side of the subexpression delimited by this operator is a query on the children elements of the element described on its left-hand side. 


@item @emph{with} Declares the constraints the items sought must satisfy. 


@end itemize  

Some examples of this query language (more can be found in the examples directory): 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Example A: 
@end itemize  


@noindent

@smallexample 
product@@val(product_name,"car")::(quantity(X), 
                                  'time-left'(Y), 
                                  negotiation::preference::price(Z)) 
       with X * Z .>. Y

@end smallexample  


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item Example B: 
@end itemize  


@noindent

@smallexample 
nitf::head::docdata::'doc-id'@@val('id-string',"020918050")::(Y), 
                     body::'body.head'::abstract::p(X)

This library is intended to eaose the task of displaying some graphical results. This library allows the programmer to visualize different graphs and tables without knowing anything about specific graphical packages. 

You need to install the BLT package in your computer. BLT is an extension to the Tk toolkit and it does not require any patching of the Tcl or Tk source files. You can find it in @uref{http://www.tcltk.com/blt/index.html} 

Basically, when the user invokes a predicate, the library (internally) creates a bltwish interpreter and passes the information through a socket to display the required widget. The interpreter parses the received commands and executes them. 

The predicates exported by this library can be classified in four main groups, according to the types of representation they provide. 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item bar charts 


@item line graphs 


@item scatter graphs 


@item tables 
@end itemize  

To represent graphs, the Cartesian coordinate system is used. I have tried to show simple samples for every library exported predicate in order to indicate how to call them.

@section Bar charts 

In this section we shall introduce the general issues about the set of barchart predicates. By calling the predicates that pertain to this group a bar chart for plotting two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates) can be created. A bar chart is a graphic means of comparing numbers by displaying bars of lengths proportional to the y-coordinates they represented. The barchart widget has many configurable options such as title, header text, legend and so on. You can configure the appearance of the bars as well. The bar chart widget has the following components: 


@table @asis 


@item Header text 

The text displayed at the top of the window. If it is @code{''} no text will be displayed. 


@item Save button 
The button placed below the header text. Pops up a dialog box for the user to select a file to save the graphic in PostScript format.@footnote{Limitation: Some printers can have problems if the PostScript file is too complex (i.e. too many points/lines appear in the picture).} 


@item Bar chart title 
The title of the graph. It is displayed at the top of the bar chart graph. If text is @code{''} no title will be displayed. 


@item X axis title 
X axis title. If text is @code{''} no x axis title will be displayed. 


@item Y axis title 
Y axis title. If text is @code{''} no y axis title will be displayed. 


@item X axis 
X coordinate axis. The x axis is drawn at the bottom margin of the bar chart graph. The x axis consists of the axis line, ticks and tick labels. Tick labels can be numbers or plain text. If the labels are numbers, they could be displayed at uniform intervals (the numbers are treated as normal text) or depending on its x-coodinate value. You can also set limits (maximum and minimum) for the x axis, but only if the tick labels are numeric. 


@item Y axis 
Y coordinate axis. You can set limits (maximum and minimum) for the y axis. The y axis is drawn at the right margin of the bar chart graph.The y axis consists of the axis line, ticks and tick labels. The tick labels are numeric values determined from the data and are drawn at uniform intervals. 


@item Bar chart graph 
This is the plotting area, placed in the center of the window and surrounded by the axes, the axis titles and the legend (if any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are determined from the data, but you can set them (as mentioned before). Data points outside the minimum and maximum value of the axes are not plotted. 


@item Legend 
The legend displays the name and symbol of each bar. The legend is placed in the right margin of the Bar chart graph. 


@item Footer text 
Text displayed at the lower part of the window. If text is @code{''} no header text will be displayed. 


@item Quit button 
Button placed below the footer text. Click it to close the window. 


@end table  

All of them are arranged in a window. However you can, for example, show a bar chart window without legend or header text. Other configuration options will be explained later. 

In addition to the window appearance there is another important issue about the bar chart window, namely its behaviour in response to user actions. The association user actions to response is called @emph{bindings}. The main bindings currently specified are the following: 


@table @asis 


@item Default bindings 
Those are well known by most users. They are related to the frame displayed around the window. As you know, you can interactively move, resize, close, iconify, deiconify, send to another desktop etc. a window. 


@item Bindings related to bar chart graph and its legend 
Clicking the left mouse key over a legend element, the corresponding bar turns out into red. After clicking again, the bar toggles to its original look. In addition, you can do zoom-in by pressing the left mouse key over the bar chart graph and dragging to select an area. To zoom out simply press the right mouse button. 

When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs are drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines (one vertical and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is over a legend element, its background changes. 


@item Bindings related to buttons 
There are two buttons in the main widget. Clicking the mouse on the Save button a "Save as" dialog box is popped up. The user can select a file to save the graph. If the user choose a file that already exists, the dialog box prompts the user for confirmation on whether the existing file should be overwritten or not. Furthermore, you can close the widget by clicking on the Quit button. 

When the pointer passes over a button the button color changes. 


@end table  

The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names begin with @strong{barchart} and @strong{genmultibar}. If you take a look at the predicate names that pertain to this group, you will notice that they are not self-explanatory. It would have been better to name the predicates in a way that allows the user to identify the predicate features by its name, but it would bring about very long names (i.e barchart_WithoutLegend_BarsAtUniformIntervals_RandomBarsColors). For this reason I decided to simply add a number after barchart to name them.

@section Line graphs 

It is frequently the case that several datasets need to be displayed on the same plot. If so, you may wish to distinguish the points in different datasets by joining them by lines of different color, or by plotting with symbols of different types. This set of predicates allows the programmer to represent two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates). Each dataset contains x and y vectors containing the coordinates of the data. You can configure the appearance of the points and the lines which the points are connected with. The configurable line graph components are: 


@table @asis 


@item line graph 
This is the plotting area, placed in the center of the window and surrounded by the axes, the axes titles and the legend (if any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are determined from the data, but you can set them. Data points outside the minimum and maximum value of the axes are not plotted. You can specify how connecting line segments joining successive datapoints are drawn by setting the @code{Smooth} argument. Smooth can be either linear, step, natural and quadratic. Furthermore, you can select the appearance of the points and lines. 


@item Legend 
The legend displays the name and symbol of each line. The legend is placed in the right margin of the graph. 
 
@end table  

The elements header, footer, quit and save buttons, the titles and the axes are quite similar to those in barchart graphs, except in that the tick labels will be numbers. All of them are arranged in a window by the geometry manager. However you can, as we mentioned in the above paragraphs, show a line graph window without any titles or footer text. Other configuration options will be explained later in this section or in the corresponding modules. 

Related to the behaviour of the widgets in response to user actions (bindings) we will remark the following features: 


@table @asis 


@item Bindings related to line graph and its legend 
Clicking the left mouse key over a legend element, the corresponding line turns out into blue. Repeating the action reverts the line to its original color. Moreover, you can do zoom-in by clicking the left mouse key over the bar chart graph and dragging a rectangle defining the area you want to zoom in. To zoom out simply press the right mouse button. 

When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs are drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines (one vertical and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is over a legend element, its background changes. 


@item Other bindings
The default bindings and the bindings related to the save and quit buttons are similar to those in the bar chart graphs. 
 
@end table  

The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names begin with @strong{graph_}.

@section Scatter graphs 

The challenge of this section is to introduce some general aspects about the scatter graph predicates group. By invoking the scatter graph predicates the user can represent two-dimensional point datasets. Often you need to display one or several point datasets on the same plot. If so, you may wish to distinguish the points that pertain to different datasets by using plotting symbols of different types, or by displaying them in different colors. This set of predicates allows you to represent two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates). Each dataset contains x and y vectors containing the coordinates of the data. You can configure the appearance of the points. The configurable scatter graph components are: 


@table @asis 


@item scatter graph 
This is the plotting area, placed in the center of the window and surrounded by the axes, the axes titles and the legend (if any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are determined from the data, but you can set them (as we mentioned before). Data points outside the minimum and maximum value of the axes are not plotted. The user can select the appearance of the points. 


@item Legend 
The legend displays the name and symbol of each point dataset. The legend is drawn in the right margin of the graph. 
 
@end table  

The elements header, footer, quit and save buttons, the titles and the axes are similar to those in barchart graphs except for that, as in line graphs, the tick labels will be numbers. All of them are arranged in a window by the geometry manager. However you can, for example, show a scatter graph window without titles or footer text, as we mentioned before. Other configuration options will be explained later, in the corresponding modules. 

Related to the behaviour of the widgets in response to user actions (bindings) the following features are: 


@table @asis 
 
@item Bindings related to scatter graph and its legend 
Clicking the left mouse key over a legend element, the points which belong to the corresponding dataset turn out into blue. Repeating the action toggles the point dataset to its original color. Moreover, you can do zoom-in by clicking the left mouse key over the bar chart graph and dragging a rectangle defining the area you want to zoom-in on. To do zoom-out simply press the right mouse button. 

When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs are drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines (one vertical and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is over a legend element, its background changes. 


@item Other bindings 
The default bindings and the bindings related to the save and quit buttons are similar to those in the bar chart graphs. 


@end table  
 
The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names began with @strong{scattergraph_}.

@section Tables 

The purpose of this section is to allow the user to display results in a table. A table is a regular structure in which: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Every row has the same number of columns, or 


@item Every column has the same number of rows. 


@end itemize  

The widget configurable components are as follows: 


@table @asis 


@item Title 

Title of the widget, it is displayed centered at the top of the canvas. If text is @code{''} no title will be displayed. 


@item Header text 

Left centered text displayed bellow the title. If text is @code{''} no header text will be displayed. 


@item Table 

Is placed in the center of the window. The table is composed by cells ordered in rows and columns. The cell values can be either any kind of text or numbers and they can be empty as well (see the type definition in the corresponding chapter module). A table is a list of lists. Each sublist is a row, so every sublist in the table must contain the same number of alements. 


@item Footer text 

Left centered text displayed at the lower part of the window. If text is @code{''} no header text will be displayed. 


@item Quit button 

Button placed below the footer text. You can click it to close the window. 


@end table  

If the arguments are not in a correct format an exception will be thrown. Moreover, these widgets have the default bindings and the binding related to the quit button:

@section Overview of widgets 
 
Although you don't have to worry about how to arrange the widgets, here is an overview of how Tcl-tk, the underlying graphical system currently used by chartlib, performs this task. Quoting from the book @emph{Tcl and Tk toolkit}, John K. Ousterhout. 

The X Window System provides many facilities for manipulating windows in displays. The root window may have any number of child windows, each of wich is called a top-level window. Top-level windows may have children of their own, wich may have also children, and so on. The descendants of top-level windows are called internal windows. Internal windows are usedfor individual controls such as buttons, text entries, and for grouping controls together. An X-application tipically manages several top-level windows. Tk uses X to implement a set of controls with the Motif look and feel. These controls are called widgets. Each widget is implemented using one X window, and the terms "window" and "widget" will be used interchangeably in this document. As with windows, widgets are nested in hierarchical structures. In this library top-level widgets (nonleaf or main) are just containers for organizing and arranging the leaf widgets (components). Thereby, the barchart widget is a top-level window wich contains some widget components. 

Probably the most painstaking aspect of building a graphical application is getting the placement and size of the widgets just right. It usually takes many iterations to align widgets and adjust their spacing. That's because managing the geometry of widgets is simply not a packing problem, but also graphical design problem. Attributes such as alignment, symmetry, and balance are more important than minimizing the amount of space used for packing. Tk is similar to other X toolkits in that it does not allow widgets to determine their own geometries. A widget will not even appeared unless it is managed by a geometry manager. This separation of geometry management from internal widget behaviour allows multiple geometry managers to exist simultaneously and permits any widget to be used with any geometry manager. A geometry manager's job is to arrange one or more @emph{slave} widgets relative to a @emph{master} widgets. There are some geometry managers in Tk such as pack, place and canvas widget. We will use another one call table.



The table geometry manager arranges widgets in a table. It's easy to align widgets (horizontally and vertically) or to create empty space to balance the arrangement of the widgets. Widgets (called slaves in the Tk parlance) are arranged inside a containing widget (called the master). Widgets are positioned at row,column locations and may span any number of rows or columns. More than one widget can occupy a single location. The placement of widget windows determines both the size and arrangement of the table. The table queries the requested size of each widget. The requested size of a widget is the natural size of the widget (before the widget is shrunk or expanded). The height of each row and the width of each column is the largest widget spanning that row or column. The size of the table is in turn the sum of the row and column sizes. This is the table's normal size. The total number of rows and columns in a table is determined from the indices specified. The table grows dynamically as windows are added at larger indices.

This module exports some predicates to interact with Tcl-tk, particularly with the bltwish program. Bltwish is a windowing shell consisting of the Tcl command languaje, the Tk toolkit plus the additional commands that comes with the BLT library and a main program that reads commands. It creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands.

This module defines predicates to show barchart widgets. The three predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data as regular bars in a window. They all share the following features: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item No numeric values for the @code{x} axis are needed because they will be interpreted as labels. See 
@glindex xbarelement1/1
@code{xbarelement1/1} definition type. 


@item The bars will be displayed at uniform intervals. 


@item The user can either select the appearance of the bars (background color, foreground color and stipple style) or not. See the 
@glindex xbarelement1
@code{xbarelement1} type definition. Thus, the user can call each predicate in two ways. 


@item The bar chart has a legend. One entry (symbol and label) per bar. 


@item If you don't want to display text in the elements header, barchart title, x axis title, y axis title or footer, simply type @code{''} as the value of the argument. 


@item The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception @code{error2} will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but are not correct, the exception @code{error1} or @code{error3} will be thrown, depending on the error type. @code{error1} means that @code{XVector} and @code{YVector} do not contain the same number of elements and @code{error3} indicates that not all the @code{XVector} elements contain a correct number of attributes . 


@end itemize  


@noindent
Particular features will be pointed out in the corresponding predicate.

@code{barchart1(Header, BarchartTitle, XTitle, XVector, YTitle, YVector, Footer)}


The @code{y} axis range is determined from the limits of the data. Two examples are given to demonstrate clearly how to call the predicates. In the first example the user sets the bar appearance, in the second one the appearance features will be chosen by the system and the colors that have been assigned to the variables Color1, Color2 and Pattern will be shown also. 

Example 1: 


@smallexample 
barchart1('This is the header text',
  'Barchart title',
  'xaxistitle',
  [ ['bar1','legend_element1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
           ['bar2','legend_element2','Plum','SeaGreen','pattern2'],
           ['bar3','legend_element3','Turquoise','Yellow','pattern5'] ],
  'yaxixtitle',
  [20,10,59],
  'footer').
@end smallexample  

Example 2: 


@smallexample 
barchart1('This is the header text',
  'Barchart title',
  'xaxistitle',
  [ ['element1','legend_element1',Color1,Color2,Pattern],
            ['element2','legend_element2'],
            ['element3','legend_element3'] ],
  'yaxixtitle',
  [20,10,59],
  'footer').
@end smallexample

@glindex barchart1/9 
@deffn PREDICATE barchart1/9:


@code{barchart1(Header, BTitle, XTitle, XVector, YTitle, YVector, YMax, YMin, Footer)}


You can set the minimum and maximum limits of the @code{y} axis. Data outside the limits will not be plotted. Each limit, as you can check by looking at the 
@glindex axis_limit/1
@code{axis_limit/1} definition, is a number. If the argument is a variable the limit will be calculated from the data (i.e., if @code{YMax} value is YValueMax the maximum y axis limit will calculated using the largest data value). 

Example: 


@smallexample 
barchart1('This is the header text',
  'Barchart title',
  'xaxistitle',
  [ ['element1','e1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
      ['element2','e2','Turquoise','Plum','pattern5'],
      ['element3','e3','Turquoise','Green','pattern5'] ],
  'yaxixtitle',
  [20,10,59],

  'footer').

@glindex percentbarchart1/7 
@deffn PREDICATE percentbarchart1/7:


@code{percentbarchart1(Header, BTitle, XTitle, XVector, YTitle, YVector, Footer)}


The y axis maximum coordinate value is 100. The @code{x} axis limits are automatically worked out. 

Example: 


@smallexample 
percentbarchart1('This is a special barchart to represent percentages',
  'Barchart with legend',
  'My xaxistitle',
  [ [1,'bar1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
       [8,'bar2','MediumTurquoise','Plum','pattern5'] ],
  'My yaxixtitle',

@deffn REGTYPE yelement/1:



 


@smallexample 
yelement(Y) :-
        number(Y).
@end smallexample  

Y is the bar lenght, so it must be a numeric value. 

Both Prolog and Tcl-Tk support integers and floats. Integers are usually specified in decimal, but if the first character is 0 the number is read in octal (base 8), and if the first two characters are 0x, the number is read in hexadecimal (base16). Float numbers may be specified using most of the forms defined for ANSI C, including the following examples: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
@item 9.56 


@item 5.88e-2 


@item 5.1E2 
@end itemize  

Note: Be careful when using floats. While 8. or 7.e4 is interpreted by Tcl-tk as 8.0 and 7.0e4, Prolog will not read them as float numbers. Example: 
@smallexample 
        ?- number(8.e+5).
        @{SYNTAX ERROR: (lns 130-130) , or ) expected in arguments
        number ( 8 
        ** here **
        . e + 5 ) . 
        @}

        no
        ?- number(8.).
        @{SYNTAX ERROR: (lns 138-138) , or ) expected in arguments
        number ( 8 
        ** here **
        . ) . 
        @}

        no

        ?- number(8.0e+5).

        yes
        ?- number(8.0).

        yes
        @end smallexample  

Precision: Tcl-tk internally represents integers with the C type @code{int}, which provides at least 32 bits of precision on most machines. Since Prolog integers can (in some implementations) exceed 32 bits but the precision in Tcl-tk depends on the machine, it is up to the progammer to ensure that the values fit into the maximum precision of the machine for integers. Real numbers are represented with the C type @code{double}, which is usually represented with 64-bit values (about 15 decimal digits of precision) using the IEEE Floating Point Standard. 

Conversion: If the list is composed by integers and floats, Tcl-tk will convert integers to floats.

This type is defined in order to set the minimum and maximum limits of the axes. Data outside the limits will not be plotted. Each limit, is a number or a variable. If the argument is not a number the limit will be calculated from the data (i.e., if YMax value is @code{Var} the maximum y axis limit will be calculated using the largest data value).

This module defines predicates which depict barchart widgets. The three predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data as regular bars in a window and are similar to those exported in the genbar1 module except in that these defined in this module do not display a legend. Thus, not all the argument types are equal. 

The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception @code{error2} will be thrown. If the vectors contain elements but are not correct, the exception @code{error1} or @code{error3} will be thrown, depending on the error type. @code{error1} means that @code{XVector} and @code{YVector} do not contain the same number of elements and @code{error3} indicates that not all the @code{XVector} elements contain a correct number of attributes .

This module defines predicates which depict barchart widgets. The three predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data as regular bars in a window and are similar to those exported in genbar2 module except in that those defined in this module doesn't display a legend. Thus, the user does not have to define legend element names. 

The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception @code{error2} will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but are not correct, the exception @code{error1} or @code{error3} will be thrown, depending on the error type. @code{error1} means that @code{XVector} and @code{YVector} do not contain the same number of elements and @code{error3} indicates that not all the @code{XVector} elements contain a correct number of attributes .

This module defines predicates which depict line graph and scatter graph widgets. All eigth predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data. Each point is defined by its X-Y coordinate values. A dataset is defined by two lists xvector and yvector, which contain the points coordinates. As you might guess, the values placed in the the same position in both lists are the coordinates of a point. They both share the following features: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Numeric values for vector elements are needed. We'll use two vectors to represent the X-Y coordinates of each set of plotted data, but in this case every dataset shares the X-vector, i.e., x-coordinate of points with the same index @footnote{It should be pointed out that I am refering to an index as the position of an element in a list.} in different datasets is the same. Thus, the numbers of points in each yvector must be equal to the number of points in the xvector. 


@item The active element color is navyblue, which means that when you select a legend element, the corresponding line or point dataset turns into navyblue. 


@item The user can either select the appearance of the lines and/or points of each dataset or not. If not, the system will choose the colors for the lines and the points among the available ones in accordance with the plot background color and it will also set the points size and symbol to the default. If the plot background color is black, the system will choose a lighter color, and the system will select a darker color when the plot background color is white. Thus, the user can define the appearanse attributes of each dataset in four different ways. Take a look at the 
@glindex attributes/1
@code{attributes/1} type definition and see the examples to understand it clearly. 


@item The graph has a legend and one entry (symbol and label) per dataset. 


@item If you do not want to display text in the element header, barchart title, xaxis title, yaxis title or footer, simply give @code{''} as the value of the argument. 


@item The predicates check whether the format of the arguments is correct as well. The testing process involves some verifications. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception @code{error2} will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but are not correct, the exception @code{error4} will be thrown. 


@end itemize  

The names of the line graph predicates begin with @strong{graph_} and those corresponding to the scatter graph group begin with @strong{scattergraph_}.

This module defines predicates which show line graph widgets. All eight predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data. Each point is defined by its X-Y coordinate values. Every predicate share the following features: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item A dataset is defined by three lists xvector, yvector and attributes. The arguments named @code{XVectors} (or @code{XVs}), @code{YVectors} (or @code{YVs}) and @code{LAtts}@footnote{In scatter graphs the attibute that contains the features of a point dataset is @code{PAtts}.} contain this information. Those arguments must be lists whose elements are also lists. The first dataset is defined by the firts element of the three lists, the second dataset is defined by the second element of the three lists and so on. 


@item Numeric values for the vector elements are needed. We will use two vectors to represent the X-Y coordinates of each set of data plotted. In these predicates the vectors can have different number of points. However, the number of elements in xvector and yvector that pertain to a certain dataset must be, obviously, equal. 


@item The active line color is blue, which means that when you select a legend element, the corresponding line turns into navyblue. 


@item The user can either select the appearance for the lines and the points or not. See the 
@glindex attributes/1
@code{attributes/1} type definition. Thus, the user can call each predicate in different ways ways. 


@item The graph has a legend and one entry (symbol and label) per dataset. 


@item If you do not want to display text in the elements header, barchart title, xaxis title, yaxis title or footer, simply give @code{''} as the value of the argument. 


@item The predicates check whether the format of the arguments is correct as well. The testing process involves some verifications. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception @code{error2} will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but are not correct, the exception @code{error4} will be thrown.

This module defines predicates which show barchart widgets. These bar charts are somewhat different from the bar charts generated by the predicates in modules genbar1, genbar2, genbar3 and genbar4. Predicates in the present module show different features of each dataset element in one chart at the same time. Each bar chart element is a group of bars, and the element features involve three vectors defined as follows: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item xvector is a list containing the names (atoms) of the bars (n elements). Each bar group will be displayed at uniform intervals. 


@item yvector is a list that contains m sublists, each one is composed of n elements. The i-sublist contains the y-values of the i-BarAttribute element for all of the XVector elements. 


@item bar_attributtes is a list containing the appearance features of the bars (m elements). Each element of the list can be partial or complete, which means that you can define as bar attributes only the element name or by setting the element name, its background and foreground color and its stipple pattern. 


@end itemize  

Other relevant aspects about this widgets are: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If you don't want to display text in the elements header, barchart title, xaxis title, yaxis title or footer, simply type @code{''} as the value of the argument. 


@item The bar chart has a legend, and one entry (symbol and label) per feature group bar. 


@item The user can either select the appearance of the bars (background color, foreground color and stipple style) or not. See the multibar_attribute type definition. 


@item Data points can have their bar segments displayed in one of the following modes: stacked, aligned, overlapped or overlayed. They user can change the mode clicking in the checkboxes associated to each mode. 


@item The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception @code{error2} will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but are not correct, the exception @code{error5} or @code{error6} will be thrown, depending on what is incorrect. @code{error5} means that @code{XVector} and each element of @code{YVector} do not contain the same number of elements or that @code{YVector} and @code{BarsAtt} do not contain the same number of elements, while @code{error6} indicates that not all the @code{BarsAtt} elements contain a correct number of attributes. 


@end itemize  

The examples will help you to understand how these predicates should be called.

The x axis limits are autoarrange. The user can call the predicate in two ways. In the first example the user sets the appearance of the bars, in the second one the appearance features will be chosen by the library. 

Example1: 
@smallexample 
multibarchart('This is the Header text',
	'My BarchartTitle',
	'Processors',
	['processor1','processor2','processor3','processor4'],
	'Time (seconds)',
	[['setup time','MediumTurquoise','Plum','pattern2'],
	    ['sleep time','Blue','Green','pattern5'],
	    ['running time','Yellow','Plum','pattern1']],
	[[20,30,40,50],[10,8,5,35],[60,100,20,50]],
	'This is the Footer text').
@end smallexample  
Example2: 
@smallexample 
multibarchart('This is the Header text',
	'My BarchartTitle',
	'Processors',
	['processor1','processor2','processor3','processor4'],
	'Time (seconds)',
	[['setup time'],['sleep time'],['running time']],
	[[20,30,40,50],[10,8,5,35],[60,100,20,50]],
	'This is the Footer text').

@deffn PREDICATE multibarchart/10:

This predicate is quite similar to

@code{multibarchart/8}, except in that you can choose limits in the y axis. The part of the bars placed outside the limits will not be plotted.

Most of the predicates exported by this module perform some checks to determine whether the arguments attain some conditions or not. In the second case an exception will be thrown. To catch the exceptions you can use the following metapredicates when invoking chartlib exported predicates: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item 
@glindex chartlib_text_error_protect/1
@code{chartlib_text_error_protect/1} 


@item 
@glindex chartlib_text_error_protect/1
@code{chartlib_text_error_protect/1} 


@end itemize  

Both metapredicates are defined in the chartlib_errhandle module that comes with this library. Some of the predicates have a @code{Predicate} argument which will be used in case of error to show which chartlib predicate causes the error.

@glindex ProVRML
@code{ProVRML} is Prolog library to handle VRML code. The library consists of modules to handle the tokenising, that is breaking the VRML code into smaller parts that can be analysed further. The further analysis will be the parsing. This is a complex part of the library and consists of several modules to handle errors and value check. When the parsing is done we have the Prolog terms of the VRML code. The terms are quite similar to the origin VRML code and can easily be read if you recognise that syntax. 

This Prolog terms of the VRML code is then possible to use for analysis, reconstruction, reverse enginering, building blocks for automatic generation of VRML code. There are several possibilities and these are only some of them. 

When you are done with the Prolog terms for the code, you would probably want to reverse the action and return to VRML code. This is done with the code generation modules. These are built up in more or less the same manner as the parser modules.

@itemize @minus
@item @emph{Description:} performance accepts a goal, @code{P}, as a first argument. The aim of this predicate is to call @code{P} several times and meassure some feature (in this version, only time, that is because no extra parameter has been added). @code{M} defines how many times @code{P} should be called. Usually, calling the predicate in some succesion (10,100,1000) and dividing by the number of times it is executed we can obtain the "execution time" of the predicate (if we are measuring time). 

The result of executions are returned in the list @code{Times} 

The diferent modes are: 
@itemize @bullet{} 
@item graph( Start , End , Increment ). It defines arithmetic succesion starting in Start and ending in End, by increment of Increment. So @code{P} is called Start times on the first time, Start+Increment on the second, etc. 


@item graph The same as graph/3 but with default options 


@item graph_exp( Start , End , Exp ). It defines geometric succesion. Start is multiplied by Exp till it gets End. So @code{P} is called Start times on the first time, Start*Exp on the second, etc. 


@item graph_exp The same as graph_exp/3 but with default options

For example, if we are doing a benchmark of qsort function, the first member will be a list for being ordered and the second one will be the length of the unordered list. The output is a list of (X,Y) points where Y means the time needed for its entry of "cost" X. @code{OutList} can be used as TimeList in predicate generate_plot. @code{Reserved} is reserved for future implementations (it will take the value of runtime, memory_used...)

This library uses @code{gnuplot} for printing graphs. 

User-friendly predicates to generate data plots are provided, as well as predicates to set the general options which govern the generation of such plots. If no options is specified, global ones are used for data plots generation. 

Several files can be generated as temporary files. A BaseName is required for generating the temporaries files. Data files name will be created from BaseName + number + .dat. The BaseName + ".plot" will be the name used for @code{gnuplot} tool. 

A list of pairs of list of pairs of the from (X,Y) and Local Option value is provided to the main predicate as data. In other words DataList = [(CurveDataList,LocalOptions), (CurveDataList1,LocalOptions1) ...]. Additionaly (function( String ) , LocalOptions) can be used for adding a curve to the plot (imagine you want to compare your result with 'x=y'). 

LocalOptions of the DataList are options that are applied to the curve, as for example, if we print the curve with lines, or the title in the legend, etc. GlobalOptions are referred to the plot options, like title in x or y axis, etc.

This module is intended to agilizy the work of calling several modules as prove cases of some program. Usually when you are developing a program you have several auto-test program cases that you would like to execute whenever you do some modification in your program/system. The predicate 
@glindex mod_tester/2
@code{mod_tester/2} was created with the propouse of execute this test an report to you which of them were correctly executed and which one were not.

This module have been created to automatizate the test that a predicate should pass hopefully. With that intention we have to provide a set of test and its correct answers. The predicate 
@glindex run_tester/10
@code{run_tester/10} will execute every test and compare it with its answer, generating two traces, one with detailed information, and another with the summary of executions of the tests.

This describes the installation procedure for the Ciao Prolog system, including libraries and manuals, from a @emph{source} distribution. This applies primarily to Unix-type systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, SunOS, etc.). However, the sources can also be compiled if so desired on Windows systems -- see @ref{Installation and compilation under Windows} for details. 

If you find any problems during installation, please refer to @ref{Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)}.

@glindex installation, Mac OS X, summary 


@noindent
@strong{Note:} it is recommended that you read the full installation instructions (specially if the installation will be shared by different architectures). However, in many cases it suffices to follow this summary: 


@enumerate  


@item Uncompress and unpackage (using 
@glindex gunzip
@code{gunzip} and @code{tar -xpf}) the distribution. This will put everything in a new directory whose name reflects the Ciao version. 


@item Enter the newly created directory (@code{SRC}). Edit 
@glindex SETTINGS
@code{SETTINGS} and check/set the variables @code{SRC}, @code{BINROOT} (where the executables will go), @code{LIBROOT} (where the libraries will go), and @code{DOCROOT} (where the documentation will go, preferably a directory @emph{accessible via} 
@glindex WWW
WWW). 


@item Type @code{gmake install}. This will build executables, compile libraries, and install everything in a directory @code{LIBROOT/ciao} and in @code{BINROOT}. 

Note that @code{gmake} refers to the 
@glindex GNU
GNU implementation of the 
@glindex make
make Un*x command, which is available in many systems (including all Linux systems and Mac OS X) simply as 
@glindex make
@code{make}. I.e., you can try simply typing @code{make install} if @code{gmake install} does not work. If typing @code{make} stops right away with error messages it is probably an older version and you need to install @code{gmake}. 


@item Make the following modifications in your startup scripts. This will make the documentation accessible, set the correct mode when opening Ciao source files in 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}, etc. Note that @code{<LIBROOT>} must be replaced with the appropriate value: 
@coindex environment variable definitions
@glindex environment variable definitions 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item For users a 
@coindex csh-compatible shell
@glindex csh-compatible shell
@emph{csh-compatible shell} (
@glindex csh
@code{csh}, 
@glindex tcsh
@code{tcsh}, ...), add to 
@glindex ~/.cshrc
@code{~/.cshrc}: 


@smallexample 
        if ( -e <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc ) then
           source <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc
        endif
@end smallexample  


@glindex Mac OS X
@code{Mac OS X} users should add (or modify) the 
@glindex path
@code{path} file in the directory @code{~/Library/init/tcsh}, adding the lines shown above. @strong{Note:} while this is recognized by the terminal shell, and therefore by the text-mode Emacs which comes with Mac OS X, the Aqua native Emacs 21 does not recognize that initialization. It is thus necessary, at this moment, to set manually the Ciao shell (ciaosh) and Ciao library location by hand. This can be done from the Ciao menu within Emacs after a Ciao Prolog file has been loaded. We suppose that the reason is that Mac OS X does not actually consult the per-user initialization files on startup. It should also be possible to put the right initializations in the .emacs file using the @code{setenv} function of Emacs-lisp, as in 


@smallexample 
(setenv "CIAOLIB" "<LIBROOT>/ciao")
@end smallexample  

The same can be done for the rest of the variables initialized in @code{<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc} 
 


@item For users of an 
@coindex sh-compatible shell
@glindex sh-compatible shell
@emph{sh-compatible shell} (
@glindex sh
@code{sh}, 
@glindex bash
@code{bash}, ...), add to 
@glindex ~/.profile
@code{~/.profile}: 


@smallexample 
        if [ -f <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile ]; then
           . <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile
        fi
@end smallexample  

This will set up things so that the Ciao executables are found and you can access the Ciao system manuals using the 
@glindex info
@code{info} command. Note that, depending on your shell, @emph{you may have to log out and back in} for the changes to take effect. 


@item Also, if you use 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} (highly recommended) add this line to your 
@glindex ~/.emacs
@code{~/.emacs} file: 


@smallexample 
        (load-file "<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTemacs.el")
@end smallexample  


@end itemize  
 


If you are installing Ciao globally in a multi-user machine, make sure that you instruct all users to do the same. If you are the system administrator, the previous steps can be done once and for all, and globally for all users by including the lines above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux 
@glindex /etc/bashrc
@code{/etc/bashrc}, 
@glindex /etc/csh.login
@code{/etc/csh.login}, 
@glindex /etc/csh.cshrc
@code{/etc/csh.cshrc}, 
@glindex /etc/skel
@code{/etc/skel}, 
@glindex /usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl
@code{/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl}, etc.). 


@item Finally, if the (freely available) 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/environment is not installed in your system, we @emph{highly recommend} that you also install it at this point (see @ref{Un*x full installation instructions} for instructions). While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very powerful 
@coindex development environment
@glindex development environment 
@emph{application development environment} which is based on 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} and which enables, e.g., source-level debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc. 


@item You may want now want to check your installation (see @ref{Checking for correct installation on Un*x}) and read the documentation, which is stored in @code{DOCROOT} (copied from @code{SRC/doc/reference}) and can be easily accessed as explained in that same section. There are special ``getting started'' sections at the beginning of the manual. 


@item If you have any problems you may want to check the rest of the instructions. The system can be @emph{uninstalled} by typing @code{gmake uninstall}. 
@coindex uninstalling
@glindex uninstalling

@enumerate  


@item @strong{Uncompress and unpackage:} (using 
@glindex gunzip
@code{gunzip} and @code{tar -xpf}) 
@coindex tar
@glindex tar 
the distribution in a suitable directory. This will create a new directory called @code{ciao-X.Y}, where @code{X.Y} is the version number of the distribution. The @code{-p} option in the 
@glindex tar
@code{tar} command ensures that the relative dates of the files in the package are preserved, which is needed for correct operation of the Makefiles. 


@item @strong{Select installation options:} Edit the file 
@glindex SETTINGS
@code{SETTINGS} and set the following variables: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item @code{SRC}: directory where the sources are stored. 
@coindex source directory
@glindex source directory 


@item @code{BINROOT}: directory where the Ciao executables will go. For example, if @code{BINROOT=/usr/local/bin}, then the Ciao 
@glindex compiler
compiler (
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}) will be stored at @code{/usr/local/bin/ciaoc}. Actually, it will be a link to @code{ciaoc-}@emph{VersionNumber}. This applies also to other executables below and is done so that several versions of Ciao can coexist on the same machine. Note that the @emph{version installed latest} will be the one started by default when typing @code{ciao}, @code{ciaoc}, etc. 
@coindex binary directory
@glindex binary directory 


@item @code{LIBROOT}: directory where the 
@glindex run-time libraries
run-time libraries will be installed. 
@coindex library directory
@glindex library directory 
The Ciao installation procedure will create a new subdirectory @code{ciao} below @code{LIBROOT} and a subdirectory below this one for each Ciao version installed. For example, if @code{LIBROOT=/usr/local/lib} and you have Ciao version @code{x.y}, then the libraries will be installed under @code{/usr/local/lib/ciao/ciao-x.y}. This allows you to install 
@glindex site-specific programs
site-specific programs under @code{/usr/local/lib/ciao} and they will not be overwritten if a new version of Ciao is installed. It also again allows having several Ciao versions installed simultaneously. 


@item @code{DOCROOT}: directory where the 
@glindex manuals
manuals will be installed. It is often convenient if this directory is accessible via 
@glindex WWW
WWW (@code{DOCROOT=/home/httpd/html/ciao}, or something like that).

it is of @emph{utmost importance} that the paths given be reachable in all the networked machines. Different machines with different architectures can share the same physical @code{SRC} directory during installation, since compilations for different architectures take place in dedicated subdirectories. Also, different machines/architectures can share the same @code{LIBROOT} directory. This saves space since the architecture-independent libraries will be shared. See @ref{Multiarchitecture support} below. 


@item @strong{Compile Ciao:} At the ciao top level directory type @code{gmake all}. 

@emph{Important:} use 
@glindex GNU make
GNU make (
@glindex gmake
@code{gmake}), not the standard 
@glindex UNIX make
UNIX make, as the latter does not support some features used during the compilation. It does not matter if the name of the executable is 
@glindex make
@code{make} or 
@glindex gmake
@code{gmake}: only make sure that it is GNU make. 

This will: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Build an 
@glindex engine
engine in @code{$(SRC)/bin/$(CIAOARCH)}, where @code{$(CIAOARCH)} depends on the architecture. The engine is the actual interpreter of the low level code into which Ciao Prolog programs are compiled. 


@item Build a new Ciao 
@glindex standalone compiler
standalone compiler (
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}), with the default paths set for your local configuration (nonetheless, these can be overridden by environment variables, as described below). 


@item Precompile all the libraries under @code{$(SRC)/lib} and @code{$(SRC)/library} using this compiler. 


@item Compile a toplevel 
@glindex Prolog shell
Prolog shell and a shell for 
@glindex Prolog scripts
Prolog scripts, 
@coindex scripts
@glindex scripts 
under the @code{$(SRC)/shell} directory. 


@item Compile some small, auxiliary applications (contained in the 
@glindex etc
@code{etc} directory, and documented in the part of the manual on 'Miscellaneous Standalone Utilities'). 


@end itemize  

This step can be repeated successively for several architectures in the same source directory. Only the engine and some small parts of the libraries (those written in 
@glindex C
C) differ from one architecture to the other. Standard Ciao Prolog code compiles into 
@glindex bytecode object files
bytecode object files (@code{.po}) and/or 
@glindex executables
executables which are portable among machines of different architecture, provided there is an executable engine accessible in every such machine. See more details below under @ref{Multiarchitecture support}. 
 
@item @strong{Check compilation:} If the above steps have been satisfactorily finished, the compiler has compiled itself and all the distribution modules, and very probably everything is fine. 


@item @strong{Install Ciao:} To install Ciao in the directories selected in the file 
@glindex SETTINGS
@code{SETTINGS} during step 2 above, type @code{gmake justinstall}. This will: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Install the executables of the Ciao 
@glindex program development tools
program development tools (i.e., the general driver/top-level 
@glindex ciao
@code{ciao}, the standalone compiler 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}, the script interpreter 
@glindex ciao-shell
@code{ciao-shell}, miscellaneous utilities, etc.) in @code{BINROOT} (see below). In order to use these tools, the @code{PATH} 
@coindex PATH
@glindex PATH 
@glindex environment variable
environment variable of users needs to contain the path @code{BINROOT}. 


@item Install the Ciao libraries under @code{LIBROOT/ciao} (these will be automatically found). 


@item Install under @code{DOCROOT} the Ciao manuals in several formats (such as GNU @code{info}, @code{html}, @code{postscript}, etc.), depending on the distribution. In order for these manuals to be found when typing @code{M-x info} within 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}, or by the standalone 
@glindex info
@code{info} and 
@glindex man
@code{man} commands, the @code{MANPATH} 
@coindex MANPATH
@glindex MANPATH 
and @code{INFOPATH} 
@coindex INFOPATH
@glindex INFOPATH 
@glindex environment variables
environment variables of users both need to contain the path @code{DOCROOT}. 


@item Install under @code{LIBROOT/ciao} the Ciao GNU 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} interface (
@glindex ciao.el
@code{ciao.el}, which provides an interactive interface to the Ciao program development tools, as well as some other auxiliary files) and a file 
@glindex DOTemacs
@code{DOTemacs} containing the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} initialization commands which are needed in order to use the Ciao 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} interface. 


@end itemize  


@item @strong{Set up user environments:} In order to automate the process of setting the variables above, the installation process leaves the files @code{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc} (for 
@glindex csh
@code{csh}-like shells), @code{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTprofile} (for 
@glindex sh
@code{sh}-like shells), and @code{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTemacs} (for emacs) with appropriate definitions which will take care of all needed 
@glindex environment variable definitions
environment variable definitions and 
@glindex emacs mode setup
emacs mode setup. Make the following modifications in your startup scripts, so that these files are used (@code{<LIBROOT>} must be replaced with the appropriate value): 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item For users a 
@coindex csh-compatible shell
@glindex csh-compatible shell
@emph{csh-compatible shell} (
@glindex csh
@code{csh}, 
@glindex tcsh
@code{tcsh}, ...), add to 
@glindex ~/.cshrc
@code{~/.cshrc}: 


@smallexample 
        if ( -e <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc ) then
           source <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc
        endif
@end smallexample  


@glindex Mac OS X
@code{Mac OS X} users should add (or modify) the 
@glindex path
@code{path} file in the directory @code{~/Library/init/tcsh}, adding the lines shown above. @strong{Note:} while this is recognized by the terminal shell, and therefore by the text-mode Emacs which comes with Mac OS X, the Aqua native Emacs 21 does not recognize that initialization. It is thus necessary, at this moment, to set manually the Ciao shell (ciaosh) and Ciao library location by hand. This can be done from the Ciao menu within Emacs after a Ciao Prolog file has been loaded. We suppose that the reason is that Mac OS X does not actually consult the per-user initialization files on startup. It should also be possible to put the right initializations in the .emacs file using the @code{setenv} function of Emacs-lisp, as in 


@smallexample 
(setenv "CIAOLIB" "<LIBROOT>/ciao")
@end smallexample  

The same can be done for the rest of the variables initialized in @code{<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc} 
 


@item For users of an 
@coindex sh-compatible shell
@glindex sh-compatible shell
@emph{sh-compatible shell} (
@glindex sh
@code{sh}, 
@glindex bash
@code{bash}, ...), add to 
@glindex ~/.profile
@code{~/.profile}: 


@smallexample 
        if [ -f <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile ]; then
           . <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile
        fi
@end smallexample  

This will set up things so that the Ciao executables are found and you can access the Ciao system manuals using the 
@glindex info
@code{info} command. Note that, depending on your shell, @emph{you may have to log out and back in} for the changes to take effect. 


@item Also, if you use 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} (highly recommended) add this line to your 
@glindex ~/.emacs
@code{~/.emacs} file: 


@smallexample 
        (load-file "<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTemacs.el")
@end smallexample  


@end itemize  
 


If you are installing Ciao globally in a multi-user machine, make sure that you instruct all users to do the same. If you are the system administrator, the previous steps can be done once and for all, and globally for all users by including the lines above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux 
@glindex /etc/bashrc
@code{/etc/bashrc}, 
@glindex /etc/csh.login
@code{/etc/csh.login}, 
@glindex /etc/csh.cshrc

@glindex /etc/skel
@code{/etc/skel}, 
@glindex /usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl
@code{/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl}, etc.). 


@item @strong{Download and install Emacs (highly recommended):} If the (freely available) 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor is not installed in your system, its installation is @emph{highly recommended} (if you are installing in a multi-user machine, you may want to do it in a general area so that it is available for other users, even if you do not use it yourself). While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very powerful 
@coindex development environment
@glindex development environment 
@emph{application development environment} which is based on 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} and which enables, e.g., source-level debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc.

@glindex ntemacs
@code{ntemacs} name it runs fine also as is on Win9X and Win2000 machines). 


@item @strong{Check installation / read documentation:} You may now want to check your installation (see @ref{Checking for correct installation on Un*x}) and read the documentation, which is stored in @code{DOCROOT} (copied from @code{SRC/doc/reference}) and can be easily accessed as explained that same section. There are special ``getting started'' sections at the beginning of the manual.

@item In the top-level shell, Prolog library modules should load correctly. Type for example @code{use_module(library(dec10_io))} --you should get back a prompt with no errors reported. 




@item To exit the top level shell, type @code{halt.} as usual, or @key{^D}. 


@item Typing 
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc} should produce the help message from the Ciao 
@glindex standalone compiler

@noindent
Also, the following documentation-related actions should work: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item If the 
@glindex info
@code{info} program is installed, typing @code{info} should produce a list of manuals which @emph{should include Ciao manual(s) in a separate area} (you may need to log out and back in so that your shell variables are reinitialized for this to work). 


@item Opening with a 
@glindex WWW browser
WWW browser (e.g.,

@coindex style sheets
@glindex style sheets
@emph{style sheets} should be activated for correct formatting of the manual. 


@item Typing @code{man ciao} should produce a man page with some very basic general information on Ciao (and pointing to the on-line manuals). 


@item The @code{DOCROOT} directory should contain the manual also in the other formats such as @code{postscript} or @code{pdf} which specially useful for printing. See @ref{Printing manuals (Un*x)} for instructions.

@code{emacs} is installed, after starting it (typing @code{emacs}) the following should work: 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Typing @key{^H} @key{i} (or in the menus @code{Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals with Info}) should open a list of manuals in info format in which the Ciao manual(s) should appear. 


@item When opening a Prolog file, i.e., a file with @code{.pl} or @code{.pls} ending, using @key{^X}@key{^F}@code{filename} (or using the menus) the code should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g., comments in red), and @code{Ciao/Prolog} menus should appear in the menu bar on top of the

@coindex multiarchitecture support
@glindex multiarchitecture support 

As mentioned before, Ciao applications (including the compiler and the top level) can run on several machines with different architectures without any need for recompiling, provided there is one Ciao engine (compiled for the corresponding architecture) accessible in each machine. Also, the Ciao libraries (installed in @code{LIBROOT}, which contain also the engines) and the actual binaries (installed in @code{BINROOT}) can themselves be shared on several machines with different architectures, saving disk space. 

For example, assume that the compiler is installed as: 

@code{/usr/local/share/bin/ciaoc} 

and the libraries are installed under 

@code{/usr/local/share/lib} 

Assume also that the @code{/usr/local/share} directory is mounted on, say, a number of 
@glindex Linux
Linux and a number of 
@glindex Solaris
Solaris boxes. In order for @code{ciaoc} to run correctly on both types of machines, the following is needed: 


@enumerate  


@item Make sure you that have done @code{gmake install} on one machine of each architecture (once for Linux and once for Solaris in our example). This recompiles and installs a new engine and any architecture-dependent parts of the libraries for each architecture. The engines will have names such as @code{ciaoengine.LINUXi86}, @code{ciaoengine.SolarisSparc}, and so on. 


@item In multi-architecture environments it is even more important to make sure that users make the modifications to their startup scripts using 
@glindex <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc
@code{<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc} etc. The selection of the engine (and architecture-dependent parts of libraries) is done in these scripts by setting the environment variable @code{CIAOARCH}, using the @code{ciao_get_arch} command, which is installed automatically when installing Ciao. This will set @code{CIAOARCH} to, say, @code{LINUXi86}, @code{SolarisSparc}, respectively, and @code{CIAOENGINE} will be set to @code{ciaoengine.}@emph{CIAOARCH}. 

However, note that this is not strictly necessary if running on only one architecture: if @code{CIAOARCH} is not set (i.e., undefined), the Ciao executables will look simply for @code{ciaoengine}, which is always a link to the latest engine installed in the libraries. But including the initialization files provided has the advantage of setting also paths for the manuals, etc.

@section Installation and compilation under Windows 

There are two possibilities in order to install Ciao Prolog on Windows machines: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Installing from the Windows @emph{precompiled} distribution. This is the easiest since it requires no compilation and is highly recommended. This is described in @ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution}. 


@item Installing the standard Ciao Prolog (Un*x) system source distribution and compiling it under Windows. This is somewhat more complex and currently requires the (freely available) Cygnus Win32 development libraries --described below. 


@end itemize  


@coindex installation, Windows, from sources
@glindex installation, Windows, from sources 
@coindex compiling, Win32
@glindex compiling, Win32 
In order to compile Ciao Prolog for Win32 environments you need to have the (public domain) 
@coindex Cygnus Win32
@glindex Cygnus Win32
@emph{Cygnus Win32} and development libraries installed in your system. Compilation should be performed preferably under Windows NT-type systems. 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Thus, the first step, if Cygnus Win32 is not installed in your system, is to download it (from, e.g., @uref{http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32}) and install it. The compilation process also requires that the executables @code{rm.exe}, @code{sh.exe}, and @code{uname.exe} from the Cygnus distribution be copied under @code{/bin} prior to starting the process (if these executables are not available under @code{/bin} the compilation process will produce a number of errors and eventually stop prematurely). 


@item Assuming all of the above is installed, type @code{make allwin32}. This will compile both the engine and the Prolog libraries. In this process, system libraries that are normally linked dynamically under Un*x (i.e., those for which @code{.so} dynamically loadable files are generated) are linked statically into the engine (this is done instead of generating @code{.dll}s because of a limitation in the current version of the Cygnus Win32 environment). No actual installation is made at this point, i.e., this process leaves things in a similar state as if you had just downloaded and uncompressed the precompiled distribution. Thus, in order to complete the installation you should now: 


@item Follow now the instructions in @ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution}. 


@end itemize  

A further note regarding the executables generated by the Ciao compiler and top-level: the same considerations given in @ref{Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution} apply regarding @code{.bat} files, etc. However, in a system in which Cygnus Win32 is installed these executables can also be used in a very simple way. In fact, the executables can be run as in Un*x by simply typing their name at the 
@glindex bash
@code{bash} shell command line without any associated @code{.bat} files. This only requires that the 
@glindex bash
@code{bash} shell which comes with Cygnus Win32 be installed and accessible: simply, make sure that 
@glindex /bin/sh.exe
@code{/bin/sh.exe} exists.

@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Porting to currently unsupported operating systems 

If you would like to port Ciao to a currently unsupported platform, there are several issues to take into account. The main one is to get the @emph{engine} to compile in that platform, i.e., the C code under the @code{engine} directory. The procedure currently followed by Ciao to decide the various flags needed to compile is as follows: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item The shell script @code{$(SRC)/etc/ciao_get_arch} is executed; it returns a string describing the operating system and the processor architecture (e.g., LINUXi86, SolarisSparc, SolarisAlpha, etc.). You should make sure it returns a correct (and meaningful) string for your setup. This string is used trhoughout the compilation to create several architecture-dependant flags. 


@item In the directory @code{$(SRC)/makefile-sysdep} there are files called mkf-<OS><ARCH> for every combination of operating system and architecture in which Ciao is know to (and how to) compile. They set several flags regarding, for example, whether to use or not threads, which threads library to use, the optimization flags to use, the compiler, linker, and it also sets separately the architecture name (ARCHNAME variable) and the operating system (OSNAME). You should create a new mkf file for your machine, starting from the one which is closest to you. 


@item Most times the porting problems happen in the use of locks and threads. You can either disable them, or have a look at the files @code{$(SRC)/engine/locks.h} and @code{$(SRC)/engine/threads.h}. If you know how to implement native (assembler) locks for your architecture, enable HAVE_NATIVE_SLOCKS for your architecture and add the definitions. Otherwise, if you have library-based locks, enable them. The mechanism in @code{threads.h} is similar. 


@end itemize  
 
Once a working engine is achieved, it should be possible to continue with the standard installation procedure, which will try to use a completely static version of the standalone compiler (@code{ciaoc.sta} in the @code{ciaoc} directory) to compile the interactive top-level (
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}) and a new version of the standalone compiler (
@glindex ciaoc
@code{ciaoc}). These in turn should be able to compile the Prolog libraries. You may also need to look at some libraries (such as, for example, 
@glindex sockets
@code{sockets}) which contain C code. If you do succeed in porting to a platform that is currently unsupported please send the 
@glindex mkf-CIAOARCH
@code{mkf-CIAOARCH} and any patches to @email{ciao@@clip.dia.fi.upm.es}, and we will include them (with due credit, of course) in the next distribution.

@glindex troubleshooting 

The following a list of common installation problems reported by users: 


@itemize @bullet{} 
 
@item @strong{Problem:} Compilation errors appear when trying a new installation/compilation after the previous one was aborted (e.g., because of errors). 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} It is a good idea to clean up any leftovers from the previous compilation using @code{make engclean} before restarting the installation or compilation process. 


@item @strong{Problem:} 

During engine compilation, messages such as the following appear: @code{tasks.c:102:PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS undeclared (first use of this function)}. 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

Your (Linux?) system does not have (yet) the 
@glindex Posix threads
Posix threads library installed. You can upgrade to one which does have it, or download the library from 

@uref{http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/index.html} 

and install it, or disable the use of threads in Linux: for this, edit the 
@glindex SETTINGS
@code{SETTINGS} file and specify @code{USE_THREADS=no}, which will avoid linking against thread libraries (it will disable the use of thread-related primitives as well). Clean the engine with @code{make engclean} and restart compilation. 

If you have any alternative threads library available, you can tinker with @code{engine/threads.h} and the files under @code{makefile-sysdep} in order to get the task managing macros right for your system. Be sure to link the right library. If you succeed, we (@email{ciao@@clip.dia.fi.upm.es}) will be happy of knowing about what you have done. 
 
@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{-lpthread: library not found} (or similar) 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

Your (Linux?) system seems to have Posix threads installed, but there is no threads library in the system. In newer releases (e.g., 
@glindex RedHat 5.0
RedHat 5.0), the Posix threads system calls have been included in @code{glibc.so}, so specifying @code{-lpthread} in @code{makefile-sysdep/mkf-LINUX} is not needed; remove it. @code{make engclean} and restart installation. 

Alternatively, you may have made a custom installation of Posix threads in a non-standard location: be sure to include the flag @code{-L/this/is/where/the/posix/libraries/are} @strong{before} @code{-lpthread}, and to update @code{/etc/ld.so.conf} (see @code{man ldconfig}). 
 
@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{Segmentation Violation} (when starting the first executable) 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

This has been observed with certain older versions of 
@glindex gcc
@code{gcc} which generated erroneous code under full optimization. The best solution is to upgrade to a newer version of 
@glindex gcc
@code{gcc}. Alternatively, lowering the level of optimization (by editing the 
@glindex SETTINGS
@code{SETTINGS} file in the main directory of the distribution) normally solves the problem, at the cost of reduced execution speed. 
 
@item @strong{Problem:} @code{ciaoc: /home/clip/lib/ciao/ciao-X.Y/engine/ciaoengine: not found} 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item The system was not fully installed and the variable @code{CIAOENGINE} was not set. 


@item The system was installed, the variable @code{CIAOENGINE} is set, but it is does not point to a valid ciaoengine.

See the file @code{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc} for user settings for environment variables. 


@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{ERROR: File library(compiler) not found - aborting...} (or any other library is not found) 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item The system was not installed and the variable @code{CIAOLIB} was not set. 


@item The system is installed and the variable @code{CIAOLIB} is wrong. 


@end itemize  

See the file @code{LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc} for user settings for environment variables. 


@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{ERROR: File <some_directory>/<some_file>.itf not found - aborting...} 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

Can appear when compiling @code{.pl} files. The file to compile (<some_file>.pl) is not in the directory <some_directory>. You gave a wrong file name or you are in the wrong directory. 
 
@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{*ERROR*: /(write_option,1) is not a regular type} (and similar ones) 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

This is not a problem, but rather the type checker catching some minor inconsistencies which may appear while compiling the libraries. Bug us to remove it, but ignore it for now. 


@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{WARNING: Predicate <some_predicate>/<N> undefined in module <some_module>} 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

It can appear when the compiler is compiling Ciao library modules. If so, ignore it (we will fix it). If it appears when compiling user programs or modules, you may want to check your program for those undefined predicates. 


@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{gmake[1]: execve: /home/clip/mcarro/ciao-0.7p2/etc/collect_modules: No such file or directory} 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

Check if collect_modules is in $(SRC)/etc and is executable. If it is not here, your distribution is incorrect: please let us know. 




@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{make: Fatal error in reader: SHARED, line 12: Unexpected end of line seen} 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

You are using standard Un*x make, not GNU's make implementation (gmake). 
 
@item @strong{Problem:} 

@code{WARNING}s or @code{ERROR}s while compiling the Ciao libraries during installation. 

@strong{Possible reason and solution:} 

It is possible that you will see some such errors while compiling the Ciao libraries during installation. This is specially the case if you are installing a Beta or Alpha release of Ciao. These releases (which have ``odd'' version numbers such as 1.5 or 2.1) are typically snapshots of the development directories, on which many developers are working simultaneously, which may include libraries which have typically not been tested yet as much as the ``official'' distributions (those with ``even'' version numbers such as 1.6 or 2.8). Thus, minor warnings may not have been eliminated yet or even errors can sneak in. These warnings and errors should not affect the overall operation of the system (e.g., if you do not use the affected library).

@coindex installation, Windows, from binaries
@glindex installation, Windows, from binaries 

This describes the installation of Ciao after downloading the Windows @emph{binary} (i.e., @emph{precompiled}) distribution. It includes the installation of libraries and manuals and applies to Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP systems. This is the simplest Windows installation, since it requires no compilation and is highly recommended. However, it is also possible to compile Ciao from the source distribution on these systems (please refer to @ref{Installing Ciao from the source distribution} for details). 

If you find any problems during installation, please refer to @ref{Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)}.

@section Win32 binary installation summary 


@noindent
Please follow these steps (below we use the terms @emph{folder} and @emph{directory} interchangeably): 


@enumerate  


@item Download the precompiled distribution and unpack it into any suitable folder, such as, e.g., @code{C:\Program Files}. 

This will create there a folder whose name reflects the Ciao version. Due to limitations of Windows related to file associations, do not put Ciao too deep in the folder hierarchy. For unpacking you will need a recent version of a zip archive manager -- there are many freely available such as 
@glindex WinZip
@code{WinZip}, 
@glindex unzip
@code{unzip}, 
@glindex pkunzip
@code{pkunzip}, etc. (see for example @code{www.winzip.com}). Some users have reported some problems with version 6.2 of WinZip, but no problems with, e.g., version 7. With WinZip, simply click on ``Extract'' and select the extraction folder as indicated above. 


@item Stop any Ciao-related applications. 

If you have a previous version of Ciao installed, make sure you do not have any Ciao applications (including, e.g., a toplevel shell) running, or the extraction process may not be able to complete. You may also want to delete the entire folder of the previous installation to save space. 


@item Open the Ciao source directory created during extraction and run (e.g. by double-clicking on it) the @code{install}(@code{.bat}) script. Answer ``yes'' to the dialog that pops up and type any character in the installation window to finish the process. You may need to reboot for the changes in the registry to take effect. 

This will update the windows registry (the file @code{ciao}(@code{.reg}) lists the additions) and also create some @code{.bat} files which may be useful for running Ciao executables from the command line. It also creates initialization scripts for the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor. The actions performed by the installation script are reported in the installation window. 


@item You may want to add a 
@coindex windows shortcut
@glindex windows shortcut
@emph{windows shortcut} 
@coindex shortcut, windows
@glindex shortcut, windows 
in a convenient place, such as the desktop, to 
@glindex ciaosh.cpx
@code{ciaosh.cpx}, the standard interactive toplevel shell. It is located inside the @code{shell} folder (e.g., click on the file 
@glindex ciaosh.cpx
@code{ciaosh.cpx} with the right mouse button and select the appropriate option, @code{Send to->Desktop as shortcut}). 


@item You may also want to add another shortcut to the file 
@glindex ciao
@code{ciao}(@code{.html}) located inside @code{doc\reference\ciao_html} so that you can open the Ciao manual by simply double-clicking on this shortcut. 


@item Finally, if the (freely available) 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/environment is not installed in your system, we @emph{highly recommend} that you also install it at this point. While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very powerful 
@coindex development environment
@glindex development environment 
@emph{application development environment} which is based on 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} and which enables, e.g., source-level debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc. If you are not convinced, consider that many programmers inside Micros*ft use @code{emacs} for developing their programs. 

 
@coindex emacs, download
@glindex emacs, download 
@coindex downloading emacs
@glindex downloading emacs 

The emacs editor (in all its versions: Un*x, Windows, etc.) can be downloaded from, for example, @uref{http://www.emacs.org/}, and also from the many GNU mirror sites worldwide (See @uref{http://www.gnu.org/} for a list), in the @code{gnu/emacs} and @code{gnu/windows/emacs} directories. You can find answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) about 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} in general at @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-faq.text} and about the Windows version at @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html} (despite the 
@glindex ntemacs
@code{ntemacs} name it runs fine also as is on Win9X and Win2000 machines). 


@coindex emacs mode, setting up, Win32
@glindex emacs mode, setting up, Win32 
You need to tell 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} how to load the Ciao mode automatically when editing and how to access the on-line documentation: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Start 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} (double click on the icon or from the @code{Start} menu). Open (menu @code{Files->Open File} or simply @key{^X}@key{^F}) the file 
@glindex ForEmacs.txt
@code{ForEmacs.txt} that the installation script has created in directory where you installed the Ciao distribution. 


@item Copy the lines in the file (select with the mouse and then menu @code{Edit->Copy}). Open/Create using 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} (menu @code{Files->Open File} or simply @key{^X}@key{^F}) the file 
@glindex ~/.emacs
@code{~/.emacs} (or, if this fails, 
@glindex c:/.emacs
@code{c:/.emacs}). 


@item Paste the two lines (menu @code{Edit->Paste} or simply @key{^Y}) into the file and save (menu @code{Files->Save Buffer} or simply @key{^X}@key{^S}). 


@item Exit 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} and start it again. 


@end itemize  


@noindent

@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} should not report any errors (at least related to Ciao) on startup. At this point the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} checks in the following section should work. 


@end enumerate  



@node Checking for correct installation on Win32, Compiling the miscellaneous utilities under Windows, Win32 binary installation summary, Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Checking for correct installation on Win32 

After the actions and registry changes performed by the installation procedure, you should check that the following should work correctly: 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Ciao-related file types (@code{.pl} source files, @code{.cpx} executables, @code{.itf,.po,.asr} interface files, @code{.pls} scripts, etc.) should have specific icons associated with them (you can look at the files in the folders in the Ciao distribution to check). 


@item Double-clicking on the shortcut to 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}(@code{.cpx}) on the desktop should start the typical Prolog top-level shell in a window. If this shortcut has not been created on the desktop, then double-clicking on the 
@glindex ciaosh
@code{ciaosh}(@code{.cpx}) icon inside the @code{shell} folder within the Ciao source folder should have the same effect. 


@item In the top-level shell, Prolog library modules should load correctly. Type for example @code{use_module(library(dec10_io)).} at the Ciao top-level prompt --you should get back a prompt with no errors reported. 


@item To exit the top level shell, type @code{halt.} as usual, or @key{^D}. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
Also, the following documentation-related actions should work: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Double-clicking on the shortcut to @code{ciao}(@code{.html}) which appears on the desktop should show the Ciao manual in your default WWW browser. If this shortcut has not been created you can double-click on the @code{ciao}(@code{.html}) file in the @code{doc\reference\ciao_html} folder inside the Ciao source folder. Make sure you configure your browser to use 
@coindex style sheets
@glindex style sheets
@emph{style sheets} for correct formatting of the manual (note, however, that some older versions of 
@glindex Explorer
Explorer did not support style sheets well and will give better results turning them off). 


@coindex printing, manual
@glindex printing, manual 
@coindex manual, printing
@glindex manual, printing 
@coindex help
@glindex help 


@item The @code{doc\reference} folder contains the manual also in the other formats present in the distribution, such as @code{info} (very convenient for users of the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} editor/program development system) and @code{postscript} or @code{pdf}, which are specially useful for printing. See @ref{Printing manuals (Win32)} for instructions. 


@end itemize  



@noindent
Finally, if 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} is installed, after starting it (double-clicking on the @code{emacs} icon or from the @code{Start} menu) the following should work: 

 
@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Typing @key{^H} @key{i} (or in the menus @code{Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals with Info}) should open a list of manuals in info format in which the Ciao manual(s) should appear. 


@item When opening a Prolog file, i.e., a file with @code{.pl} or @code{.pls} ending, using @key{^X}@key{^F}@code{filename} (or using the menus) the code should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g., comments in red), and @code{Ciao/Prolog} menus should appear in the menu bar on top of the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} window. 


@item Loading the file using the @code{Ciao/Prolog} menu (or typing @key{^C} @key{l}) should start in another emacs buffer the Ciao toplevel shell and load the file. You should now be able to switch the the toplevel shell and make queries from within 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}. 


@end itemize  


@noindent
@strong{Note:} when using 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} it is @emph{very convenient} to swap the locations of the (normally not very useful) @key{Caps Lock} key and the (very useful in 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs}) @key{Ctrl} key on the keyboard. How to do this is explained in the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} frequently asked questions FAQs (see the 
@glindex emacs
@code{emacs} download instructions for their location). 



If you find that everything works but @code{emacs} cannot start the Ciao toplevel you may want to check if you can open a normal Windows shell within @code{emacs} (just do @key{M-x} @code{shell}). If you cannot, it is possible that you are using some anti-virus software which is causing problems. See @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html#anti-virus} for a workaround. 

In some Windows versions it is possible that you had to change the @emph{first} backslashes in the DOTemacs.el file in the Ciao Directory. E.g., assuming you have installed in drive @code{c:}, instances of @code{c:\} need to be changed to @code{c:/}. For example: @code{c:\prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat} should be changed to @code{c:/prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat}.

@section Compiling the miscellaneous utilities under Windows 

The 
@glindex etc
@code{etc} folder contains a number of utilities, documented in the manual in @emph{PART V - Miscellaneous Standalone Utilities}. In the Win32 distribution these utilities are not compiled by the installation process. You can create the executable for each of them when needed by compiling the corresponding @code{.pl} file.

@coindex installation, Windows server
@glindex installation, Windows server 

If you would like to install Ciao on a server machine, used by several clients, the following steps are recommended: 


@itemize @bullet{} 


@item Follow the standard installation procedure on the server. When selecting the folder in which Ciao is installed make sure you select a folder that is visible by the client machines. Also make sure that the functionality specified in the previous sections is now available on the server. 


@item Perform a 
@coindex client installation
@glindex client installation
@emph{client installation} on each client, by running (e.g., double-click on it) the 
@glindex client.bat
@code{client.bat} script. This should update the registry of each client. At this point all the functionality should also be available on the clients. 


@end itemize  



@node CGI execution under IIS, Uninstallation under Windows, Server installation under Windows, Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section CGI execution under IIS 

The standard installation procedure updates the windows registry so that Ciao executables (ending in @code{.cpx}) are directly executable as CGIs under Microsoft's IIS, i.e., so that you make applications written in Ciao available on the WWW (see the 
@glindex pillow
@code{pillow} library for specific support for this task). In the event you re-install IIS, you probably would lose the entries in the registry which allow this. In that case, processing the file 
@glindex ciao.reg
@code{ciao.reg} produced during the installation (or simply reinstalling Ciao) will add those entries again. 



@node Uninstallation under Windows,  , CGI execution under IIS, Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution
@comment node-name, next,  previous,  up
@section Uninstallation under Windows 



To uninstall Ciao under Windows, simply delete the directory in which you put the Ciao distribution. If you also want to delete the registry entries created by the Ciao installation (not strictly needed) this must currently be done by hand. The installation leaves a list of these entries in the file 
@glindex ciao.reg
@code{ciao.reg} to aid in this task. Also, all the register entries contain the word @emph{ciao}. Thus, to delete all Ciao entries, run the application 
@glindex regedit
@code{regedit} (for example, by selecting @code{Run} from the Windows @code{Start} menu), search (@key{^F}) for @emph{ciao} in all registry entries (i.e., select all of @code{Keys}, @code{Values}, and @code{Data} in the @code{Edit->Find} dialog), and delete each matching key (click on the left window to find the matching key for each entry found).

@section Architecture-specific notes and limitations 


@coindex limitations, architecture-specific
@glindex limitations, architecture-specific 
Ciao makes use of advanced characteristics of modern architectures and operating systems such as multithreading, shared memory, sockets, locks, dynamic load libraries, etc., some of which are sometimes not present in a given system and others may be implemented in very different ways across the different systems. As a result, currently not all Ciao features are available in all supported operating systems. Sometimes this is because not all the required features are present in all the OS flavors supported and sometimes because we simply have not had the time to port them yet. 

The current state of matters is as follows: 


@table @asis 
@item LINUX: 
multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working. 
@item Solaris: 
multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working. 
@item IRIX: 
multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working. 
@item SunOS 4: 
multithreading, shared DB access, and locking NOT working. 
@item Win 95/98/NT/2000/XP: 
multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working. Dynamic linking of object code (C) libraries NOT working. 
@item Mac OS X (Darwin): 
multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working. 
@end table  

The features that do not work are disabled at compile time.

@itemize @bullet{} 


@item For @emph{installation problems} we typically need to have the version and patch number of the Ciao package (e.g., the name of the file downloaded), the output produced by the installation process (you can capture it by redirecting the output into a file or cutting and pasting with the mouse), and the exact version of the Operating System you are using (as well as the C compiler, if you took a source distribution). 


@item For @emph{problems during use} we also need the Ciao and OS versions and a small example of code which we can run to reproduce the bug.
