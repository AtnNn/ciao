<H1><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC56">PART I - The program development environment</A></H1>

<P>
This part documents the components of the basic Ciao program development environment. They include: 


<DL COMPACT>

<DT>ciaoc:
<DD>
the standalone compiler, which creates executables without having to enter the interactive top-level. 

<DT>ciaosh:
<DD>
(also invoked simply as <CODE>ciao</CODE>) is an interactive top-level shell, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (with some enhancements). 

<DT>debugger.pl:
<DD>
a Byrd box-type debugger, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (also with some enhancements, such as source-level debugging). This is not a standalone application, but is rather included in 
<A NAME="IDX432"></A>
<CODE>ciaosh</CODE>, as is done in other Prolog systems. However, it is also <EM>embeddable</EM>, in the sense that it can be included as a library in executables, and activated dynamically and conditionally while such executables are running. 

<DT>ciao-shell:
<DD>
an interpreter/compiler for <EM>Prolog scripts</EM> (i.e., files containing Prolog code which run without needing explicit compilation). 

<DT>ciao.el:
<DD>
a <EM>complete program development enviroment</EM>, based 
<A NAME="IDX433"></A>
<A NAME="IDX434"></A>
<A NAME="IDX435"></A>
<A NAME="IDX436"></A>
on 
<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
GNU emacs, with syntax coloring, direct access to all the tools described above (as well as the preprocessor and the documenter), atomatic location of errors, source-level debugging, context-sensitive access to on-line help/manuals, etc. The use of this environment is <EM>very highly recommended</EM>! 

</DL>

<P>
The Ciao program development environment also includes 
<A NAME="IDX438"></A>
<CODE>ciaopp</CODE>, the 
<A NAME="IDX439"></A>
preprocessor, and 
<A NAME="IDX440"></A>
<CODE>lpdoc</CODE>, the 
<A NAME="IDX441"></A>
documentation generator, which are described in separate manuals.
