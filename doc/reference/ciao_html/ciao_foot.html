<P>Currently there is an exception to this related to libraries which are written in languages other than Prolog, as, e.g., C. C files are currently always compiled to dynamically loadable object files (<CODE>.so</CODE> files), and they thus need to be included manually in a distribution of an application. This will be automated in upcoming versions of the Ciao system.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="ciao_5.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>It is also possible to produce real standalone executables, i.e., executables that do not need to have an engine around. However, this is not automated yet, although it is planned for an upcoming version of the compiler. In particular, the compiler can generate a <CODE>.c</CODE> file for each <CODE>.pl</CODE> file. Then all the <CODE>.c</CODE> files can be compiled together into a real executable (the engine is added one more element during link time) producing a complete executable for a given architecture. The downside of course is that such an executable will not be portable to other architectures without recompilation.

<P>The server can be downloaded from the same site(s) as the CIAO system. The downloaded package contains complete installation instructions for the server. Before trying to run the CIAO Prolog side of things, make sure that the server is correctly installed and running, and that it can be accessed from the small sample client that comes with the server distribution. Once this is achieved, connection from CIAO should not pose problems.
