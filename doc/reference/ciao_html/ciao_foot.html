<P>Currently there is an exception to this related to libraries which are written in languages other than Prolog, as, e.g., C. C files are currently always compiled to dynamically loadable object files (<CODE>.so</CODE> files), and they thus need to be included manually in a distribution of an application. This will be automated in upcoming versions of the Ciao system.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="ciao_6.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>It is also possible to produce real standalone executables, i.e., executables that do not need to have an engine around. However, this is not automated yet, although it is planned for an upcoming version of the compiler. In particular, the compiler can generate a <CODE>.c</CODE> file for each <CODE>.pl</CODE> file. Then all the <CODE>.c</CODE> files can be compiled together into a real executable (the engine is added one more element during link time) producing a complete executable for a given architecture. The downside of course is that such an executable will not be portable to other architectures without recompilation.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="ciao_108.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>It is also possible to provide active modules via a WWW address. However, we find it more straightforward to simply use socket addresses. In any case, this is generally hidden inside the access method and can be thus made transparent to the user.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="ciao_192.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>Limitation: Some printers can have problems if the PostScript file is too complex (i.e. too many points/lines appear in the picture).
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="ciao_200.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>It should be pointed out that I am refering to an index as the position of an element in a list.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="ciao_201.html#DOCF6">(6)</A></H3>
<P>In scatter graphs the attibute that contains the features of a point dataset is <CODE>PAtts</CODE>.
