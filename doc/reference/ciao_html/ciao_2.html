<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC3">About this manual</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>


<P>
This is the <EM>Reference Manual</EM> for the Ciao Prolog development system. It contains basic information on how to install Ciao Prolog and how to write, debug, and run Ciao Prolog programs from the command line, from inside GNU 
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<CODE>emacs</CODE>, or from a windowing desktop. It also documents all the libraries available in the standard distribution. 


<P>
 This manual has been generated using the 
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<EM>LPdoc</EM> semi-automatic documentation generator for LP/CLP programs [HC97,Her00]. 
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<CODE>lpdoc</CODE> processes Prolog files (and files in other CLP languages) adorned with assertions and machine-readable comments, which should be written in the Ciao 
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
assertion language [PBH97,PBH00]. From these, it generates manuals in many formats including <CODE>postscript</CODE>, <CODE>pdf</CODE>, <CODE>texinfo</CODE>, <CODE>info</CODE>, <CODE>HTML</CODE>, <CODE>man</CODE>, etc., as well as on-line help, ascii <CODE>README</CODE> files, entries for indices of manuals (<CODE>info</CODE>, WWW, ...), and maintains WWW distribution sites. 


<P>
The big advantage of this approach is that it is easier to keep the on-line and printed documentation in sync with the source code [Knu84]. As a result, <EM>this manual changes continually as the source code is modified</EM>. Because of this, the manual has a version number. You should make sure the manual you are reading, whether it be printed or on-line, coincides with the version of the software that you are using. 


<P>
The approach also implies that there is often a variability in the degree to which different libraries or system components are documented. Many libraries offer abundant documentation, but a few will offer little. The latter is due to the fact that we tend to include libraries in the manual if the code is found to be useful, even if they may still contain sparse documentation. This is because including a library in the manual will at the bare minimum provide formal information (such as the names of exported predicates and their arity, which other modules it loads, etc.), create index entries, pointers for on-line help in the electronic versions of the manuals, and command-line completion capabilities inside 
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<CODE>emacs</CODE>. Again, the manual is being updated continuously as the different libraries (and machine-readable documentation in them) are improved. 




<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC4">About the Ciao Prolog development system</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>


<P>
 The Ciao system is a full programming environment for developing programs in the Prolog language and in several other languages which are extensions and modifications of Prolog in several interesting and useful directions. The programming environment offers a number of tools such as the Ciao standalone compiler (<CODE>ciaoc</CODE>), a traditional-style top-level interactive shell (<CODE>ciaosh</CODE> or <CODE>ciao</CODE>), an interpreter of scripts written in Prolog (<CODE>ciao-shell</CODE>), a Prolog <CODE>emacs</CODE> mode (which greatly helps the task of developing programs with support for editing, debugging, version/change tracking, etc.), numerous libraries, a powerful program preprocessor (<CODE>ciaopp</CODE> [BdlBH99,BLGPH99,HBPLG99], which supports static debugging and optimization from program analysis via source to source program transformation), and an automatic documentation generator (<CODE>lpdoc</CODE>) [HC97,Her00]. A number of execution visualization tools [CGH93,CH00d,CH00c] are also available. 


<P>
This manual documents the first four of the tools mentioned above [see PART I - The program development environment], and the Ciao Prolog language and libraries. The <CODE>ciaopp</CODE> and <CODE>lpdoc</CODE> tools are documented in separate manuals. 
 
The Ciao language [see PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)] has been designed from the ground up to be small, but to also allow extensions and restrictions in a modular way. The first objective allows producing small executables (including only those builtins used by the program), providing basic support for pure logic programming, and being able to write scripts in Prolog. The second one allows supporting standard ISO-Prolog [see PART III - ISO-Prolog library (iso)], as well as powerful extensions such as constraint logic programming, functional logic programming, and object-oriented logic programming [see PART VII - Ciao Prolog extensions], and restrictions such as working with pure horn clauses. 


<P>
The design of Ciao has also focused on allowing modular program development, as well as automatic program manipulation and optimization. Ciao includes a robust module system [CH00a], module-based automatic incremental compilation [CH99], and modular global program analysis, debugging and optimization [PH99], based on a rich assertion language [see PART V - Annotated Prolog library (assertions)] for declaring (optional) program properties (including types and modes), which can be checked either statically or dynamically. The program analysis, static debugging and optimization tasks related to these assertions are performed by the <CODE>ciaopp</CODE> preprocessor, as mentioned above. These assertions (together with special comment-style declarations) are also the ones used by the <CODE>lpdoc</CODE> autodocumenter to generate documentation for programs (the comment-style declarations are documented in the <CODE>lpdoc</CODE> manual). 


<P>
Ciao also includes several other features and utilities, such as support for several forms of executables, concurrency (threads), distributed and parallel execution, higher-order, WWW programming (PiLLoW [CHV96b]), interfaces to other languages like C and Java, database interfaces, graphical interfaces, etc., etc. [see PARTS VI to XI]. 




<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC5">ISO-Prolog compliance versus extensibility</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>


<P>
 One of the innovative features of Ciao is that it has been designed to subsume 
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<EM>ISO-Prolog</EM> (International Standard ISO/IEC 13211-1, PROLOG: Part 1--General Core [DEDC96]), while at the same time extending it in many important ways. The intention is to ensure that all ISO-compliant Prolog programs run correctly under Ciao. At the same time, the Ciao module system (see [PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)] and [CH00a] for a discussion of the motivations behind the design) allows selectively avoiding the loading of most ISO-builtins (and changing some other ISO characteristics) when not needed, so that it is possible to work with purer subsets of Prolog and also to build small executables. Also, this module system makes it possible to develop extensions using these purer subsets (or even the full ISO-standard) as a starting point. Using these features, the Ciao distribution includes libraries which significantly extend the language both syntactically and semantically. 


<P>
Compliance with ISO is still not complete: currently there are some minor deviations in, e.g., the treatment of characters, the syntax, some of the arithmetic functions, and part of the error system. On the other hand, Ciao has been reported by independent sources (members of the standarization body) to be one of the most conforming Prologs at the moment of this writing, and the first one to be able to compile all the standard-conforming test cases. Also, Ciao does not offer a strictly conforming mode which rejects uses of non-ISO features. However, in order to aid programmers who wish to write standard compliant programs, library predicates that correspond to those in the ISO-Prolog standard are marked specially in the manuals, and differences between the Ciao and the prescribed ISO-Prolog behaviours, if any, are commented appropriately. 


<P>
The intention of the Ciao developers is to progressively complete the compliance of Ciao with the published parts of the ISO standard as well as with other reasonable extensions of the standard may be published in the future. However, since one of the design objectives of Ciao is to address some shortcomings of previous implementations of Prolog and logic programming in general, we also hope that some of the better ideas present in the system will make it eventually into the standards.

<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>


<P>
 After reading the previous sections the sharp reader may have already seen the logic behind the 'Ciao Prolog' name. Ciao is an interesting word which means both <EM>hello</EM> and <EM>goodbye</EM>. Ciao Prolog intends to be a really good, all-round, freely available ISO-Prolog system which can be used as a classical Prolog, in both academic and industrial environments (and, in particular, to introduce users to Prolog and to constraint and logic programming --the <EM>hello</EM> part). But Ciao is also a new-generation, multiparadigm programming language and program development system which goes well beyond Prolog and other classical logic programming languages. And it has the advantage (when compared to other systems) that it does so while keeping full Prolog compatibility when needed.

<A NAME="IDX36"></A>


<P>
 This manual is not meant to be an introduction to the Prolog language. The reader is referred to standard textbooks on Prolog such as [SS86,CM81,Apt97,Hog84]. However, we would like to refresh herein some concepts for the sake of establishing terminology. Also, we will briefly introduce a few of the extensions that Ciao brings to the Prolog language. 



<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ciao_2.html#SEC9">Predicates and their components</A>
<LI><A HREF="ciao_2.html#SEC10">Characters and character strings</A>

<LI><A HREF="ciao_2.html#SEC14">Declarations</A>

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC9">Predicates and their components</A></H3>

<P>
In Prolog, procedures are called <EM>predicates</EM> and predicate calls <EM>literals</EM>. They all have the classical syntax of procedures (and of logic predications and of mathematical functions). Predicates are identified in this manual by a keyword 'PREDICATE' at the right margin of the place where they are documented. 


<P>
Prolog instructions are expressions made up of control constructs (@xref{Control constructs/predicates}) and literals, and are called <EM>goals</EM>. Literals are also (atomic) goals. 


<P>
A predicate definition is a sequence of clauses. A clause has the form "<CODE>H :- B.</CODE>" (ending in '<CODE>.</CODE>'), where <CODE>H</CODE> is syntactically the same as a literal and is called the clause <EM>head</EM>, and <CODE>B</CODE> is a goal and is called the clause <EM>body</EM>. A clause with no body is written "<CODE>H.</CODE>" and is called a <EM>fact</EM>. Clauses with body are also called <EM>rules</EM>. A Prolog program is a sequence of predicate definitions. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC10">Characters and character strings</A></H3>

<P>
We adopt the following convention for delineating character strings in the text of this manual: when a string is being used as a Prolog atom it is written thus: <CODE>user</CODE> or <CODE>'user'</CODE>; but in all other circumstances double quotes are used (as in <CODE>"hello"</CODE>). 


<P>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
When referring to keyboard characters, printing characters are written thus: <KBD>a</KBD>, while control characters are written like this: <KBD>^A</KBD>. Thus <KBD>^C</KBD> is the character you get by holding down the <KBD>CTL</KBD> key while you type <KBD>c</KBD>. Finally, the special control characters carriage-return, line-feed and space are often abbreviated to <KBD>RET</KBD>, <KBD>LFD</KBD> and <KBD>SPC</KBD> respectively. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC11">Predicate specs</A></H3>

<P>
Predicates in Prolog are distinguished by their name <EM>and</EM> their arity. We will call <CODE>name/arity</CODE> a 
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<EM>predicate spec</EM>. The notation <CODE>name/arity</CODE> is therefore used when it is necessary to refer to a predicate unambiguously. For example, <CODE>concatenate/3</CODE> specifies the predicate which is named "concatenate" and which takes 3 arguments. 


<P>
(Note that different predicates may have the same name and different arity. Conversely, of course, they may have the same arity and different name.) 




<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC12">Modes</A></H3>

<P>
When documenting a predicate, we will often describe its usage with a 
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
mode spec which has the form <CODE>name(Arg1, ..., ArgN)</CODE> where each <CODE>Arg</CODE> may be preceded by a 
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<EM>mode</EM>. A mode is a functor which is wrapped around an argument (or prepended if defined as an operator). Such a mode allows documenting in a compact way the 
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
instantiation state on call and exit of the argument to which it is applied. The set of modes which can be used in Ciao is not fixed. Instead, arbitrary modes can be defined by in programs using the 
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<CODE>modedef/1</CODE> declarations of the Ciao 
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<EM>assertion language</EM> (section <A HREF="ciao_59.html#SEC258">The Ciao assertion package</A> for details). Modes are identified in this manual by a keyword 'MODE'. 


<P>
Herein, we will use the set of modes defined in the Ciao 
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<CODE>isomodes</CODE> library, which is essentially the same as those used in the 
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
ISO-Prolog standard (section <A HREF="ciao_64.html#SEC280">ISO-Prolog modes</A>). 




<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC13">Properties and types</A></H3>

<P>
Although Ciao Prolog is <EM>not</EM> a typed language, it allows writing (and using) types, as well as (more general) properties. There may be properties of the states and of the computation. Properties of the states allow expressing characteristics of the program variables during computation, like in <CODE>sorted(X)</CODE> (<CODE>X</CODE> is a sorted list). Properties of the computation allow expressing characteristics of a whole computation, like in <CODE>is_det(p(X,Y))</CODE> (such calls yield only one solution). Properties are just a special form of predicates (section <A HREF="ciao_61.html#SEC267">Declaring regular types</A>) and are identified in this manual by a keyword 'PROPERTY'. 


<P>
Ciao types are <EM>regular types</EM> (section <A HREF="ciao_61.html#SEC267">Declaring regular types</A>), which are a special form of properties themselves. They are identified in this manual by a keyword 'REGTYPE'. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC14">Declarations</A></H3>

<P>
A <EM>declaration</EM> provides information to one of the Ciao environment tools. Declarations are interspersed in the code of a program. Usually the target tool is either the compiler (telling it that a predicate is dynamic, or a meta-predicate, etc.), the preprocessor (which understands declarations of properties and types, assertions, etc.), or the autodocumenter (which understands the previous declarations and also certain "comment" declarations). 


<P>
A declaration has the form <CODE>:- D.</CODE> where <CODE>D</CODE> is syntactically the same as a literal. Declarations are identified in this manual by a keyword 'DECLARATION'. 


<P>
In Ciao users can define (and document) new declarations. New declarations are typically useful when defining extensions to the language (which in Ciao are called packages). Such extensions are often implemented as 
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
expansions (see section <A HREF="ciao_29.html#SEC168">Extending the syntax</A>). There are many such extensions in Ciao. The 
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<CODE>functions</CODE> library, which provides fuctional syntax, is an example. The fact that in Ciao expansions are local to modules (as operators, see below) makes it possible to use a certain language extension in one module without affecting other modules. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC15">Operators</A></H3>

<P>
An <EM>operator</EM> is a functor (or predicate name) which has been declared as such, thus allowing its use in a prefix, infix, or suffix fashion, instead of the standard procedure-like fashion. E.g., declaring <CODE>+</CODE> as an infix operator allows writing <CODE>X+Y</CODE> instead of <CODE>'+'(X,Y)</CODE> (which may still, of course, be written). 


<P>
<EM>Operators in Ciao are local to the module/file where they are declared</EM>. However, some operators are standard and allowed in every program (see section <A HREF="ciao_39.html#SEC203">Defining operators</A>). This manual documents the operator declarations in each (library) module where they are included. As with expansions, the fact that in Ciao operators are local to modules makes it possible to use a certain language extension in one module without affecting other modules.

<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC17">PART I - The program development environment</A></H3>

<P>
This part documents the components of the basic Ciao program development environment. They include: 


<DL COMPACT>

<DT>ciaoc:
<DD>
the standalone compiler, which creates executables without having to enter the interactive top-level. 

<DT>ciaosh:
<DD>
(also invoked simply as <CODE>ciao</CODE>) is an interactive top-level shell, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (with some enhancements). 

<DT>debugger.pl:
<DD>
a Byrd box-type debugger, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (also with some enhancements, such as source-level debugging). This is not a standalone application, but is rather included in 
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<CODE>ciaosh</CODE>, as is done in other Prolog systems. However, it is also <EM>embeddable</EM>, in the sense that it can be included as a library in executables, and activated dynamically and conditionally while such executables are running. 

<DT>ciao-shell:
<DD>
an interpreter/compiler for <EM>Prolog scripts</EM> (i.e., files containing Prolog code which run without needing explicit compilation). 

<DT>ciao.el:
<DD>
a <EM>complete program development enviroment</EM>, based 
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
on 
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
GNU emacs, with syntax coloring, direct access to all the tools described above (as well as the preprocessor and the documenter), atomatic location of errors, source-level debugging, context-sensitive access to on-line help/manuals, etc. The use of this environment is <EM>very highly recommended</EM>! 

</DL>

<P>
The Ciao program development environment also includes 
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<CODE>ciaopp</CODE>, the 
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
preprocessor, and 
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
<CODE>lpdoc</CODE>, the 
<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
documentation generator, which are described in separate manuals. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC18">PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)</A></H3>

<P>
 This part documents the 
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<EM>Ciao basic builtins</EM>. These predefined predicates and declarations are available in every program, unless the 
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<CODE>pure</CODE> package is used (by using a <CODE>:- module(_,_,[pure]).</CODE> declaration or <CODE>:- use_package(pure).</CODE>). These predicates are contained in the <CODE>engine</CODE> directory 
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
within the <CODE>lib</CODE> library. 
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
The rest of the library predicates, including the packages that provide most of the 
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
ISO-Prolog builtins, are documented in subsequent parts. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC19">PART III - ISO-Prolog library (iso)</A></H3>

<P>
 This part documents the 
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<EM>iso</EM> package which provides to Ciao programs (most of) the ISO-Prolog functionality , including the 
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<EM>ISO-Prolog builtins</EM> not covered by the basic library. All these predicates are loaded by default in user files and in modules which use standard module declarations such as: 


<P>
<CODE>:- module(<EM>modulename</EM>,<EM>exports</EM>).</CODE> 


<P>
which are equivalent to: 


<P>
<CODE>:- module(<EM>modulename</EM>,<EM>exports</EM>,[iso]).</CODE> 


<P>
or 


<P>
<CODE>:- module(<EM>modulename</EM>,<EM>exports</EM>).</CODE> 


<P>
<CODE>:- use_package([iso]).</CODE> 


<P>
If you do not want these ISO builtins loaded for a given file (in order to make the executable smaller) you can ask for this explicitly using: 


<P>
<CODE>:- module(<EM>modulename</EM>,<EM>exports</EM>,[]).</CODE> 


<P>
or 


<P>
<CODE>:- module(<EM>modulename</EM>,<EM>exports</EM>).</CODE> 


<P>
<CODE>:- use_package([]).</CODE> 


<P>
See the description of the declarations for declaring modules and using other modules, and the documentation of the 
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<CODE>iso</CODE> library for details. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC20">PART IV - Classic Prolog library (classic)</A></H3>

<P>
This part documents some Ciao libraries which provide additional predicates and functionalities that, despite not being in the ISO standard, are present in many popular Prolog systems. This includes definite clause grammars (DCGs), "Quintus-style" internal database, list processing predicates, dictionaries, string processing, DEC-10 Prolog-style input/output, formatted output, dynamic loading of modules, activation of operators at run-time, etc. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC21">PART V - Annotated Prolog library (assertions)</A></H3>

<P>
Ciao allows <EM>annotating</EM> the program code with <EM>assertions</EM>. Such assertions include 
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
type and 
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
instantiation mode declarations, but also more general properties as well as comments in the style of the <EM>literate programming</EM>. These assertions document predicates (and modules and whole applications) and can be used by the Ciao preprocessor/compiler while debugging and optimizing the program or library, and by the Ciao documenter to build the program or library reference manual. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC22">PART VI - Ciao Prolog library miscellanea</A></H3>

<P>
This part documents several Ciao libraries which provide different useful additional functionalities. Such functionalities include performing operating system calls, gathering statistics from the Prolog engine, file and file name manipulation, error and exception handling, fast reading and writing of terms (
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
marshalling and 
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
unmarshalling), file locking, program reporting messages, pretty-printing programs and assertions, a browser of the system libraries, additional expansion utilities, concurrent aggregates, graph visualization, etc. 




<H3><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC23">PART VII - Ciao Prolog extensions</A></H3>

<P>
The libraries documented in this part extend the Ciao language in several different ways. The extensions include:

<EM>&#38;-Prolog</EM> 
<A NAME="IDX134"></A>
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
<EM>parallel Prolog</EM> engine and

<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<EM>SICStus Prolog</EM> [Car88]. SICStus is an excellent, high performance Prolog system, developed by

<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<EM>Mats Carlsson</EM> and colleagues at the

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Version 1.9 (2002/5/16, 23:17:34 CEST)</STRONG>
<DD>
 New development version after stable 1.8p0 (MCL, DCG)

<DT><STRONG>Version 1.8 (2002/5/16, 21:20:27 CEST)</STRONG>
<DD>
 

<UL>
<LI>Improvements related to supported platforms:


<UL>
<LI>Support for Mac OS X 10.1, based on the Darwin kernel.

<LI>Initial support for compilation on Linux for Power PC (contributed by

<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
<EM>Paulo Moura</EM>). 
<LI>Workaround for incorrect C compilation while using newer (&#62; 2.95) gcc compilers.

<LI>.bat files generated in Windows.

</UL>

<LI>Changes in compiler behavior and user interface:


<UL>
<LI>Corrected a bug which caused wrong code generation in some cases.

<LI>Changed execution of initialization directives. Now the initialization of a module/file never runs before the initializations of the modules from which the module/file imports (excluding circular dependences).

<LI>The engine is more intelligent when looking for an engine to execute bytecode; this caters for a variety of situations when setting explicitly the CIAOLIB environment variable.

<LI>Fixed bugs in the toplevel: behaviour of <CODE>module:main</CODE> calls and initialization of a module (now happens after related modules are loaded).

<LI>Layout char not needed any more to end Prolog files.

<LI>Syntax errors now disable .itf creation, so that they show next time the code is used without change.

<LI>Redefinition warnings now issued only when an unqualified call is seen.

<LI>Context menu in Windows can now load a file into the toplevel.

<LI>Updated Windows installation in order to run CGI executables under Windows: a new information item is added to the registry.

<LI>Added new directories found in recent Linux distributions to INFOPATH.

<LI>Emacs-based environment and debugger improved:


<UL>
<LI>Errors located immediataly after code loading.

<LI>Improved ciao-check-types-modes (preprocessor progress now visible).

<LI>Fixed loading regions repeatedly (no more predicate redefinition warnings).

<LI>Added entries in

<A NAME="IDX246"></A>
<CODE>ciaopp</CODE> menu to set verbosity of output. 
<LI>Fixed some additional xemacs compatibility issues (related to searches).

<LI>Errors reported by inferior processes are now explored in forward order (i.e., the first error rewported is the first one highlighted). Improved tracking of errors.

<LI>Specific tool bar now available, with icons for main fuctions (works from emacs 21.1 on). Also, other minor adaptations for working with emacs 21.1 and later.

<LI>Debugger faces are now locally defined (and better customization). This also improves comtability with xemacs (which has different faces).

<LI>Direct access to a common use of the preprocessor (checking modes/types and locating errors) from toolbar.

<LI>Inferior modes for Ciao and CiaoPP improved: contextual help turned on by default.

<LI>Fixes to set-query. Also, previous query now appears in prompt.

<LI>Improved behaviour of stored query.

<LI>Improved behaviour of recentering, finding errors, etc.

<LI>Wait for prompt has better termination characteristics.

<LI>Added new interactive entry points (M-x): ciao, prolog, ciaopp.

<LI>Better tracking of last inferior buffer used.

<LI>Miscellanous bugs removed; some colors changed to adapt to different Emacs versions.

<LI>Fixed some remaining incompatibilities with xemacs.

<LI><CODE>:- doc</CODE> now also supported and highlighted.

<LI>Eliminated need for calendar.el

<LI>Added some missing library directives to fontlock list, organized this better.

</UL>

</UL>

<LI>New libraries added to the system:


<UL>
<LI>hiord: new library which needs to be loaded in order to use higher-order call/N and P(X) syntax. Improved model for predicate abstractions.

<LI>fuzzy: allows representing fuzzy information in the form or Prolog rules.

<LI>use_url: allows loading a module remotely by using a WWW address of the module source code

<LI>andorra: alternative search method where goals which become deterministic at run time are executed before others.

<LI>iterative deepening (id): alternative search method which makes a depth-first search until a predetermined depth is reached. Complete but in general cheaper than breadth first.

<LI>det_hook: allows making actions when a deterministic situation is reached.

<LI>ProVRML: read VRML code and translate it into Prolog terms, and the other way around.

<LI>io_alias_redirection: change where stdin/stdout/stderr point to from within Ciao Prolog programs.

<LI>tcl_tk: an interface to Tcl/Tk programs.

<LI>tcl_tk_obj: object-based interface to Tcl/Tk graphical objects.

<LI>CiaoPP: options to interface with the CiaoPP Prolog preprocessor.

</UL>

<LI>Some libraries greatly improved:


<UL>
<LI>WebDB: utilities to create WWW-based database interfaces.

<LI>Improved java interface implementation (this forced renaming some interface primitives).

<LI>User-transparent persistent predicate database revamped:


<UL>
<LI>Implemented passerta_fact/1 (asserta_fact/1).

<LI>Now it is never necessary to explicitly call init_persdb, a call to initialize_db is only needed after dynamically defining facts of persistent_dir/2. Thus, pcurrent_fact/1 predicate eliminated.

<LI>Facts of persistent predicates included in the program code are now included in the persistent database when it is created. They are ignored in successive executions.

<LI>Files where persistent predicates reside are now created inside a directory named as the module where the persistent predicates are defined, and are named as F_A* for predicate F/A.

<LI>Now there are two packages: persdb and 'persdb/ll' (for low level). In the first, the standard builtins asserta_fact/1, assertz_fact/1, and retract_fact/1 are replaced by new versions which handle persistent data predicates, behaving as usual for normal data predicates. In the second package, predicates with names starting with 'p' are defined, so that there is not overhead in calling the standard builtins.

<LI>Needed declarations for persistent_dir/2 are now included in the packages.

</UL>

<LI>SQL now works with mysql.

<LI>system: expanded to contain more predicates which act as interface to the underlying system / operating system.

</UL>

<LI>Other libraries improved:


<UL>
<LI>xref: creates cross-references among Prolog files.

<LI>concurrency: new predicates to create new concurrent predicates on-the-fly.

<LI>sockets: bugs corrected.

<LI>objects: concurrent facts now properly recognized.

<LI>fast read/write: bugs corrected.

<LI>Added 'webbased' protocol for active modules: publication of active module address can now be made through WWW.

<LI>Predicates in library(dynmods) moved to library(compiler).

<LI>Expansion and meta predicates improved.

<LI>Pretty printing.

<LI>Assertion processing.

<LI>Module-qualified function calls expansion improved.

<LI>Module expansion calls goal expansion even at runtime.

</UL>

<LI>Updates to builtins (there are a few more; these are the most relevant):


<UL>
<LI>Added a prolog_flag to retrieve the version and patch.

<LI>current_predicate/1 in library(dynamic) now enumerates non-engine modules, prolog_sys:current_predicate/2 no longer exists.

<LI>exec/* bug fixed.

<LI>srandom/1 bug fixed.

</UL>

<LI>Updates for C interface:


<UL>
<LI>Fixed bugs in already existing code.

<LI>Added support for creation and traversing of Prolog data structures from C predicates.

<LI>Added support for raising Prolog exceptions from C predicates.

<LI>Preliminary support for calling Prolog from C.

</UL>

<LI>Miscellaneous updates:


<UL>
<LI>Installation made more robust.

<LI>Some pending documentation added.

<LI>'ciao' script now adds (locally) to path the place where it has been installed, so that other programs can be located without being explicitly in the $PATH.

<LI>Loading programs is somewhat faster now.

<LI>Some improvement in printing path names in Windows.
