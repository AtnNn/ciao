<P>
This module provides basic mechanisms for using concurrency and implementing multi-goal applications.
<A NAME="IDX1913"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1914"></A>
It provides a means for arbitrary goals to be specified to be run in a separate stack set; in that case, they are assigned a goal identifier with which further accesses (e.g., asking for more solutions) to the goal can be made. Additionally, in some architectures, these goals can be assigned an O.S. thread, separate from the one which made the initial call, thus providing concurrency and, in multiprocessors, parallelism capabilities. 


<P>
As for now, the memory space of the threads (c.f., stack sets) is separate in the sense that goals are copied to the new stack set, and bindings of variables are not seen among stack sets which allows forward and backward execution to proceed independently in each stack set, at the cost of the initial goal copy. However, the program space (including, specially, the 
<A NAME="IDX1915"></A>
concurrent predicates) are shared and seen by all the goals and threads, and should be used as the primary means of communication and synchronization. Higer level libraries can be built using these basic blocks. 


<P>
Additionally, a small set of lock primitives are provided. Locks are associated with atom names. Whereas the concurrent database facilities are enough to implement locks, semaphores, messages, etc., the predicates implementing atom-based locks are faster than the ones accessing the concurrent database (but they are less powerful).

<STRONG>Usage 3:</STRONG> <CODE>atom_lock_state(Atom,Value)</CODE>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Description:</EM> Sets the semaphore associated to <CODE>Atom</CODE> to <CODE>Value</CODE>. This is usually done at the beginning of the execution, but can be executed at any time. If not called, semaphore associated to atoms are by default inited to 1. It should be used with caution: arbitrary use can transform programs using locks in a mess of internal relations. The change of a semaphore value in a place other than the initialization stage of a program is <STRONG>not</STRONG> among the allowed operations as defined by Dijkstra [Dij65,BA82].

<LI><EM>The following properties should hold at call time:</EM>

<CODE>Atom</CODE> is currently a term which is not a free variable.

<STRONG>This library is being rewritten at the moment. The Prolog interface herein described may not correspond exactly with the existing implementation. This note will be removed when the documentation corresponds to the implementation.</STRONG>

<LI>

Available architectures implementing POSIX threads and in Windows 32 environments.

<LI>

Some implementation of threads have a limit on the total number of threads that can be created by a process. Thread creation, in this case, just hangs. A better solution is planned for the future.
