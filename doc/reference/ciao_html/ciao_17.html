<P>
This chapter documents the basic 
<A NAME="IDX1182"></A>
builtin directives in Ciao, additional to the documented in other chapters. These 
<A NAME="IDX1183"></A>
directives are natively interpreted by the Ciao compiler (
<A NAME="IDX1184"></A>
<CODE>ciaoc</CODE>). 


<P>
Unlike in other Prolog systems, directives in Ciao are not goals to be <EM>executed</EM> by the compiler or top level. Instead, they are <EM>read</EM> and acted upon by these programs. The advantage of this is that the effect of the directives is consistent for executables, code loaded in the top level, code analyzed by the preprocessor, etc. 


<P>
As a result, by default only the builtin directives or declarations defined in this manual can be used in user programs. However, it is possible to define new declarations 
<A NAME="IDX1185"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1186"></A>
using the 
<A NAME="IDX1187"></A>
<CODE>new_declaration/1</CODE> and 
<A NAME="IDX1188"></A>
<CODE>new_declaration/2</CODE> directives (or using packages including them). Also, packages may define new directives via code translations.
