<P>
This module provides basic mechanisms for using concurrency and implementing multi-goal applications.
<A NAME="IDX1509"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1510"></A>
Goals can be specified to be run in a separate stack set; in that case, they are assigned a goal identifier with which further accesses (e.g., asking for more solutions) to the goal can be made. Additionally, in some architectures, these goals can be assigned an O.S. thread, separate from the one which made the initial call. On the architectures for which we were not able to implement it yet, the original thread switches to the new stack set, executes the goal there, and returns after it has completed. 


<P>
As for now, the memory space of the threads (c.f., stack sets) is separate in the sense that goals are copied to the new stack set, and bindings of variables are not seen among stack sets which allows forward and backward execution to proceed independently in each stack set, at the cost of the initial goal copy. However, the program space (including, specially, the 
<A NAME="IDX1511"></A>
concurrent predicates) are shared and seen by all the goals and threads. 


<P>
Additionally, a small set of lock-related predicates are provided: locks are associated with atom names. Whereas the concurrent database facilities are enough to implement locks, semaphores, messages, etc., the predicates implementing atom-based locks are faster than the ones accessing the concurrent database.

If not called, semaphore associated to atoms are by default inited to 1. It should be used with caution: arbitrary use can transform programs using locks in a mess of internal relations. The change of a semaphore value in a place other than the initialization stage of a program is <STRONG>not</STRONG> among the allowed operations as defined by Dijkstra [Dij65,BA82].

<LI><EM>The following properties should hold at call time:</EM>

<CODE>Atom</CODE> is currently a term which is not a free variable.

<UL>

<LI>

Not fully available in all architectures yet.

<LI>

Some implementation of threads have a limit on the total number of threads that can be created by a process (not only threads active at a time, but threads created at all). Thread creation, in this case, just hangs. A better solution is planned for the future.

<LI>

The thread-related part of the library is not yet final, an some characteristics may be revised in a near future. A higher level library for concurrency and distribution based on the low-level primitives in this module is being implemented.
