MYCIN databases are declared as Prolog modules containing mycin rules. Those rules are given a 
<A NAME="IDX6487"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6488"></A>
<EM>certainty factor</EM> (<EM>CF</EM>) which denotates an expert's credibility on that rule: 

<UL>

<LI>A value of -1 stands for <EM>surely not</EM>.

<LI>A value of 1 stands for <EM>certainly</EM>.

<LI>A value of 0 stands for <EM>I don't know</EM>.

</UL>

<P>
Intermediate values are allowed. 


<P>
Mycin rules work on a different way as Prolog clauses: a rule will never fail (in the Prolog sense), it will return a certainty value instead. As a consequence <STRONG>all</STRONG> mycin rules will be explored during inference, so the order in which rules are written is not significant. For this reason, the usage of the Prolog <EM>cut</EM> (!) is discouraged.

<UL>

<LI><STRONG>Library usage:</STRONG>

In order to declare a mycin database you must include the following declaration as the first one in your file: 

<PRE>
           :- mycin(MycinDataBaseName).
</PRE>

<LI><STRONG>New declarations defined:</STRONG>

<A NAME="IDX6489"></A>
<CODE>export/1</CODE>.

</UL>

<DD><A NAME="IDX6492"></A>


<P>
This directive allows a given mycin predicate to be called from Prolog programs. The way in which mycin rules are called departs from Prolog ones. For instance, the followin mycin predicate: 

<PRE>
:- export p/1.
</PRE>

<P>
must be called from Prolog Programs as: <CODE>mycin(p(X),CF)</CODE>, where CF will be binded to the resulting 
<A NAME="IDX6493"></A>
certainty factor. Obviously, the variables on <EM>P/1</EM> may be instantiated as you wish. Since the Prolog predicate <EM>mycin/2</EM> may be imported from several mycin databases, it is recommended to fully qualify those predicate goals. For example : <CODE>mydatabase:mycin(p(X),CF)</CODE>. 


<P>
<STRONG>Usage:</STRONG> :- <CODE>export(Spec)</CODE>.

<UL>
<LI><EM>Description:</EM> <CODE>Spec</CODE> will be a callable mycin predicate.

</UL>

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC665" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC665">Known bugs and planned improvements (<CODE>mycin</CODE>)</A></H2>


<UL>

<LI>

Not fully implemented.

<LI>

Dynamic mycin predicates not implemented: open question.

<LI>

Importation of user-defined mycin predicates requires further design. This includes importation of mycin databases from another mycin database.
