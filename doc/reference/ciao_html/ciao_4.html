<H1><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="ciao_toc.html#TOC16">PART I - The program development environment</A></H1>

<P>
This part documents the components of the basic Ciao program development environment. They include: 


<DL COMPACT>

<DT>ciaoc:
<DD>
the standalone compiler, which creates executables without having to enter the interactive top-level. 

<DT>ciaosh:
<DD>
(also invoked simply as <CODE>ciao</CODE>) is an interactive top-level shell, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (with some enhancements). 

<DT>debugger.pl:
<DD>
a Byrd box-type debugger, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (also with some enhancements). This is not a standalone application, but is rather included in 
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<CODE>ciaosh</CODE>, as in other Prolog systems. 

<DT>ciao-shell:
<DD>
an interpreter/compiler for <EM>Prolog scripts</EM> (i.e., files containing Prolog code which run without needing explicit compilation). 

<DT>ciao.el:
<DD>
a GNU 
<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
emacs interface, which provides syntax coloring, atomatic location of errors, access to on-line manuals, etc. and greatly facilitates the interaction with the tools above. 

</DL>

<P>
The Ciao program development environment also includes 
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
<CODE>ciaopp</CODE>, the 
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>
preprocessor, and 
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
<CODE>lpdoc</CODE>, the 
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
documentation generator, which are described in separate manuals.
