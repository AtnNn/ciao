* Improvement and Bugs fixes in the engine:      
      * Got rid of some segmentation violation problems.
      * Number of significant decimal digits to be printed now computed 
            accurately.
      * Added support to test conversion of a Ciao integer into a machine 
            int.
      * Unbound length atoms now always working.
      * C interface .h files reachable through a more standard location 
            (thanks to R. Bagnara).
      * Compatibility with command line options of newer versions of gcc.
      
* New libraries and utilities added to the system:    
    * Components: utilities to build modules frontiers.
    * Factsdb: facts defined in external files can now be automatically 
          cached on-demand.
    * Symfnames: File aliasing to internal streams added.

* More libraries added (still in development):    
    * fd: clp(FD)
    * xml_path: XML querying and transformation to Prolog.
    * xdr_handle: XDR schema to HTML forms utility.
    * ddlist: Double linked list library.
    * gnuplot: Interface to GnuPlot.
    * time_analyzer: Execution time profiling.

* Some libraries greatly improved:    
    * Pillow library improved in many senses.          
          * HTTP media type parameter values returned are always strings 
                now, not atoms. 
          * Changed verbatim() pillow term so that newlines are translated 
                to <br>.
          * Changed management of cookies so that special characters in 
                values are correctly handled. 
          * Added predicate url_query_values/2, reversible. Predicate 
                url_query/2 now obsolete.
          * Now attribute values in tags are escaped to handle values 
                which have double quotes.
          * Improved get_form_input/1 and url_query/2 so that names of 
                parameters having unusual characters are always
                correctly handled.
          
    * Fixed bug in library tokenize regarding non-terminated single or 
          multiple-line comments.  When the last line of a file has a 
          single-line comment and does not end in a newline, it is accepted 
          as correct.  When an open-comment /* sequence is not terminated in 
          a file, a syntax error is thrown.
    
* Other libraries improved:    
    * Added native_props to assertions package and include nonground/1.
    * In atom2terms, changed interpretation of double quoted strings so 
          that they are not parsed to terms.
    * Control on exceptions in active modules improved.
    * Added native/1+2 to basic_props.
    * Davinci error processing improved.
    * Foreign interfaces are now automatically declared as 
          implementation-defined ones.
    * In lists, added cross_product/2 to compute the cartesian product
          of a list of lists. Also added delete_non_ground/3, enabling 
	  deletion of nonground terms  from a list. 
    * In llists added transpose/2 and changed append/2 implementation
          with a much more efficient code. 
    * The make library has been improved.
    * In persdb added pretractall_fact/1 and retractall_fact/1 as
          persdb native capabilities.
    * Some minor updates in persdb_sql.
    * Added treatment of Operators and module:pred calls to pretty-printer.
    * Updated report of read of syntax errors.
    * File locking capabilities included.
    * New input/output facilities added to socket-related library.
    * Added most_specific_generalization/3 and most_general_instance/3
          to terms_check.
    * Added sort_dict/2 to vndict.
    * The xref library now treats also empty references.
    
* Miscellaneous updates:      
      * Extended documentation in libraries actmods, arrays, 
            foreign_interface, javall, persdb_mysql, prolog_sys, old_database, 
            and terms_vars.
