@item Improvements related to supported platforms:
    @begin{itemize}
    @item Support for Mac OS X, based on the Darwin kernel
    @item Initial support for compilation on Linux for Power PC
        (contributed by Paulo Moura) 
    @item Workaround for incorrect C compilation while using newer
         (> 2.95) gcc compilers.
    @end{itemize}

@item Changes in behavior and user interface:
    @begin{itemize}
    @item Changed execution of initialization directives.  Now the
            initialization of a module/file never runs before the
            initializations of the modules from which the module/file
            imports (excluding circular dependences).
    @item Fixed bugs in the toplevel: behaviour of @{module:main} calls and 
            initialization of a module (now happens after related
	    modules are loaded).
    @item Layout char not needed any more to end Prolog files.
    @item Syntax errors now disable .itf creation, so that they show next
        time the code is used without change.
    @item Context menu in Windows can now load a file into the toplevel.
    @item Updated Windows installation in order to run CGI executables under
            Windows: a new information item is added to the registry.
    @item Added new directories found in recent Linux distributions to
            INFOPATH. 
    @item Emacs-based environment and debugger improved:

	@begin{itemize}
	@item Specific tool bar now available, with icons for main fuctions 
	(works from emacs 21.1 on). Also, other minor adaptations for 
        working with emacs 21.1 and later.
	@item Inferior modes for Ciao and CiaoPP improved: contextual
         help turned on by default.
	@item Fixes to set-query. Also, previous query now appears in prompt.
	@item Added new interactive entry points (M-x): ciao, prolog, ciaopp.
	@item Better tracking of last inferior buffer used.
	@end{itemize}

    @end{itemize}

@item New libraries added to the system:
    @begin{itemize}
    @item hiord: now needs to be loaded in order to use higher-order
            call/N and P(X) syntax.
            Improved model for predicate abstractions.
    @item fuzzy: allows representing fuzzy information in the form or
            Prolog rules.
    @item use_url: allows loading a module remotely by using a WWW
            address of the module source code
    @item andorra: alternative search method where goals which become
            deterministic at run time are executed before others.
    @item iterative deepening (id): alternative search method which makes a
            depth-first search until a predetermined depth is reached.
            Complete but in general cheaper than breadth first.
    @item det_hook: allows making actions when a deterministic
            situation is reached.
    @item ProVRML: read VRML code and translate it into Prolog terms,
            and the other way around.
    @item io_alias_redirection: change where stdin/stdout/stderr point to
            from within Ciao Prolog programs.
    @item tcl_tk: an interface to Tcl/Tk programs.
    @item tcl_tk_obj: object-based interface to Tcl/Tk graphical objects.
    @end{itemize}

@item Some libraries greatly improved:
    @begin{itemize}
    @item persdb: user-transparent persistent predicate
          database. Also, SQL version now  works with more databases
          (e.g., mysql).
    @item system: expanded to contain more predicates which
            act as interface to the underlying system /  operating system.
    @item Greatly improved java interface implementation (this forced
            renaming some interface primitives). 
    @item WebDB: utilities to create WWW-based database interfaces.
@end{itemize}

@item Other libraries improved:
    @begin{itemize}
    @item xref: creates cross-references among Prolog files.
    @item concurrency: new predicates to create new concurrent
          predicates on-the-fly.
    @item sockets: bugs corrected.
    @item fast read/write: bugs corrected.
    @item Added 'webbased' protocol for active modules: publication of
            active module address can now be made through WWW.
    @item Predicates in library(dynmods) moved to library(compiler).
    @item Expansion and meta predicates improved.
    @item Pretty printing.
    @item Assertion processing.
    @item Foreign interface.
    @end{itemize}

@item Updates to builtins (there are a few more; these are the most relevant):
    @begin{itemize}
    @item current_predicate/1 in library(dynamic) now enumerates
            non-engine modules, prolog_sys:current_predicate/2 no longer
            exists.
    @item exec/* bug fixed.
    @end{itemize}
@end{itemize}
