===========================================================================
                    A GENERAL TESTS SUITE FOR CIAO
===========================================================================

This is a general test suite for Ciao, which contains tests for the
language and its implementation, which allows measuring:

 - correctness of compiler, optimizer, analyzer, etc. (including
   parser, pretty print, output, ...)

 - performance (time, memory consumption) of the engine, runtime, libraries,
   compiler and analysis

 - comparison with other languages and implementations

Other tests that are NOT found in this tests suite are:

 - unit tests (better placed close to the code)
 - tests for very specific (such as GUIs, bindings to third part
   foreign libraries, etc.) or experimental parts
