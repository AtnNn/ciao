Improved syntax for higher order

New Java interface

Mac OS X supported

The installation program in Windows now adds an entry in the registry
   for running Ciao executables as CGIs under IIS

Now syntax errors disable .itf generation and compilation.  This way,
   the next time the file is treated, errors will appear again


Many improvements:
   @begin{itemize}

   @item Implemented passerta_fact/1 (asserta_fact/1).

   @item Now it is never necessary to explicitly call init_persdb, a call
         to initialize_db is only needed after dynamically defining facts
         of persistent_dir/2.  Thus, pcurrent_fact/1 predicate eliminated.

   @item Facts of persistent predicates included in the program code are
         now included in the persistent database when it is created.
         They are ignored in successive executions.

   @item Files where persistent predicates reside are now created inside
         a directory named as the module where the persistent predicates
         are defined, and are named as F_A* for predicate F/A.

   @item Now there are two packages: persdb and 'persdb/ll' (for low
         level).  In the first, the standard builtins asserta_fact/1,
         assertz_fact/1, and retract_fact/1 are replaced by new versions
         which handle persistent data predicates, behaving as usual for
         normal data predicates.  In the second package, predicates with
         names starting with 'p' are defined, so that there is not
         overhead in calling the standard builtins.

   @item Needed declarations for persistent_dir/2 are now included in
         the packages.

   @end{itemize}
