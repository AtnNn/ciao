When changing/adding modules to the engine builtins, follow the next steps:

1) If changing the name of a module, or adding a new module, edit the
   file builtin_modules.pl and change/add the necessary fact.


2) If changes were done in previous step or the set of predicates
   exported by an existing module has changed, make an executable from
   $CIAOHOME/lib/compiler/browse_builtins.pl (using ciaoc -x) and execute it
   to create a new engine('builtin_exports.pl').  This step should use
   CIAOLIB pointing to the _sources_ of Ciao Prolog.

OR (highly recommended!!!!)

2') Execute in this directory "make exports"


3) If any of the conditions of the two previous steps hold, recompile
   ciaoc and ciaosh (delete ciaoshcope.po).
