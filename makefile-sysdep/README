    For addition of more machines and architectures, update getarch,
make a reasonable entry in available-processors, and add the
corresponding makefile-ARCH.

    I have been told that LINUX glibc v. 2 (aka libc v. 6) has
LinuxThreads (the POSIX Threads implementation used by CIAO) included
in it, and not as a external library.  Therefore, the mkf-LINUX should
not include "-lpthread" in the definition of the Makefile LIBS variable.
