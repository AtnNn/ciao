MAN - Set up emacs mode: location of errors. Scripts.

Pending tasks in windows distribution
-------------------------------------

DAN - Recompile engine.

!DAN - There is INSTALL (unrecognizable) and INSTALL-Win32.
      - Delete INSTALL (only confuses)
      - INSTALL-Win32 sould have shorter name: call it simply INSTALL
      (change in dist Makefile)

!DAN - COMMON and SETTINGS: delete them? They probably only confuse things?

!DAN - folder makefile-sysdep has no use (should be deleted?). Also
      Makefile and makefile-sysindep.

!DAN - make executable => Make executable (when cliking on a .pl file with
      right button)

!DAN - Icon should have a ':-' somewhere (e.g., for the pl files, in the 
       yellow dot).

DAN/MCL? - Why doesn't statistics(runtime,X) work on Win32?

DAN/MCL - executing a call to shell/1 shell/0 gives 'segmentation
  violation'. I assume it is the popen problem. Should check if we are
  in Windows95/98?

MAN - Add uninstall instructions for windows (manual). Changed listed in
     ciao.reg. Eliminate reg entries where it says ciao. Eliminate
     folder. All reg entries include the word 'ciao'.

(No idea how to fix it:)

- Clicking on install.bat leaves a stupid dos install.PIF garbage file.

- We should be able to add an entry in the start menu for the shell
  and the manuals in html format. 

- There should be an uninstall.

??? - When clicking on a file, an option should be to open it in emacs (or, 
  ideally, a user-selectable editor).

Pending tasks in general
------------------------

MAN - In emacs mode: add .pls to auto-mode-alist
MAN - In emacs mode: replace all CIAO with Ciao/Prolog
MAN - In emacs mode: highlight atoms (from ' to ' but not 0' or '')


MAN - Add a hw.pl to tests.

!DAN - statistics/2 is still in dummy!!! (but statistics/0 is in
      prolog_sys). I hope statistics/0 is not written in C... 
      move from dummy to prolog_sys
      rename dummy -> odd

MAN - Software site is very ugly under windows: eliminate font comends
      (use stylesheet).  

MAN - When an index is empty, texi2html leaves a funny 'Jump to' message.

MAN - convert-texinfo.el in ciao/emacs should probably go to the lpdoc
      library.

ALL - Add references in manuals to all the new papers (on modules,
      etc.). E.g., in intro: make a special section on it.

ALL - It says in several places that we distribute under the GNU GPL, but
      we also include the Artistic license: we need to meet and decide on this.

Future:
-------

- We should do all the same for gnome/kde (can we use the same icons?)

- Utilities in etc. not compiled. Should they be???? 
  For now we simply say that they exist and can be compiled (done!)
