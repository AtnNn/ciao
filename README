The Ciao Prolog Program Development System
==========================================

   *Ciao* is a *public domain* programming environment which supports
the development and efficient compilation of *logic programs*,
*constraint logic programs* (CLP), *functional logic programs*, and
*object-oriented logic programs*. In particular, *Ciao* includes
standard *ISO-Prolog* as a sublanguage and a program development
environment similar to that of traditional Prolog and CLP
implementations. However, *Ciao* extends the Prolog language and
improves on traditional Prolog programming environments in a number
of significant ways:

   * *Ciao* offers support for *programming in the large* with a
     robust module/object system, module-based automatic incremental
     compilation (with no need for makefiles), an assertion language
     for declaring (*optional*) program properties (including types
     and modes), automatic static inference and static/dynamic
     checking of such assertions, etc.

   * *Ciao* also offers support for *programming in the small*
     producing small executables (including only those builtins used
     by the program) and support for Prolog scripts.

   * The *Ciao* compiler generates several forms of
     architecture-independent and stand-alone executables. Library
     modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C source files,
     and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded.

   * *Ciao* supports concurrency (threads), distributed execution,
     and parallel execution.

   * The *Ciao* programming environment includes a large number of
     *libraries* providing a wide range of additional functionality,
     from WWW programming to support for several control rules.

   * The *Ciao* programming environment also includes `lpdoc', a tool
     for generating documentation automatically for Prolog programs
     adorned with (*Ciao*) assertions and special, machine-readable
     comments.

   The *Ciao* language has been designed from the ground up to be
highly extensible (in a modular way) and to allow modular program
development, global program analysis, and static debugging and
optimization via source to source program transformation, including
automatic parallelization. The latter tasks are performed by the
*Ciao preprocessor* (`ciaopp', distributed separately). The *Ciao*
system also includes a rich `emacs' interface and a number of
execution visualization tools.

   *Ciao* is distributed under the GNU general public license.
