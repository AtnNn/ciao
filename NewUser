Information for first-time Ciao users under Un*x
================================================

   The following are the instructions for new Ciao users. This
instructions are referred to when the `ciao' command is issued, but
the startup files (`.cshrc', `.profile', `.emacs', etc.) have not
been set up for Ciao:

   Welcome to the Ciao Prolog Development System!

   *WARNING*: your shell initialization scripts have not ben properly
modified for locating the Ciao on-line documentation. Please add the
following lines to your shell initialization script(s):

   * For users a *csh-compatible shell* (`csh', `tcsh', ...), add to
     `~/.cshrc':

                  if ( -e <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc ) then
                     source <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTcshrc
                  endif

   * For users of an *sh-compatible shell* (`sh', `bash', ...), add
     to `~/.profile':

                  if [ -f <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile ]; then
                     . <LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTprofile
                  fi

     This will set up things so that the Ciao executables are found
     and you can access the Ciao system manuals using the `info'
     command.

   * Also, if you use `emacs' (highly recommended) add this line to
     your `~/.emacs' file:

                  (load-file "<LIBROOT>/ciao/DOTemacs")

   If you are the system administrator, the previous steps can be
done once and for all, and globally for all users by including the
lines above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux
`/etc/cshrc'/`/etc/csh.cshrc', `/etc/bashrc',
`/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl', etc.).

   The on-line manuals are available by typing <^h> <i> in `emacs',
starting `info' in a shell, or visiting:

   <LPDOCDIR>

where the Ciao Prolog documentation has been stored in several
formats.

   You may also want to join on the ciao-users mailing list, in order
to receive information on new versions and solutions to problems:
simply send a message to <ciao-users-request>, containing in the body
the word:

   `subscribe'

alone in one line. Messages are strictly limited to issues directly
related to Ciao Prolog and your email address will of course be kept
strictly confidential. See for more info:
