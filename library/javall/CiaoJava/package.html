<P>
This package includes all of the classes needed to use both java-to-prolog
and prolog-to-java interfaces. These interfaces are designed to work in a
client/server mode, so one side process (java or prolog) listens requests
from the other side. However, because these interfaces use sockets to
connect java and prolog, phisically only the java side works as socket
server, until the communication with prolog is established. After this, the
interface works as an usual client/server system, where the server is
basically a endless loop until receives a termination request.

Is under development the integration between the two interfaces so the
processes will be listening each other.

<P>

The package is composed of several types of classes: prolog data types
representation classes (<code>PLAtom</code>, <code>PLFloat</code>,
<code>PLInteger</code>, <code>PLList</code>, <code>PLString</code>,
<code>PLStructure</code>, <code>PLVariable</code>, and the abstract class
<code>PLTerm</code>); prolog execution model classes
(<code>PLConnection</code> and <code>PLGoal</code>); java interface
exceptions (<code>PLException</code> and <code>PLGoalException</code>); and
other classes (<code>PLEventListener</code> for java event handling,
<code>PLJavaServer</code> to implement the java object server in the prolog-to-java interface).

<P>

Using the <b>prolog-to-java</b> interface, should not be necessary to know
anything about this implementation classes, except
<code>PLJavaServer</code>, to launch the java object server. This class
includes itself a <code>main()</code> method to be launched in standalone
mode. This method can be called also from initialization code to do the
startup work before the java object server can process prolog requests.

<P>

In the other hand, with the <b>java-to-prolog</b> interface, prolog data
representation classes and prolog execution model classes must be known in
order to handle the data and execution structures related to the prolog
side of the interface. Specifically, before any prolog processing can be
done, a <code>PLConnection</code> object must be created, using the
appropriate constructor ({@link
CiaoJava.PLConnection#PLConnection(java.lang.String)}). Once a prolog
connection has been established, prolog goals can be created and launched
using the {@link CiaoJava.PLConnection#query(CiaoJava.PLTerm)} method, or
creating a new <code>PLGoal</code> object.
