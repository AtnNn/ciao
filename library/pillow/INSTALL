INSTALL
*******

   To correctly install PiLLoW, please follow the following steps:

  1. Copy the files in the `images' directory to a WWW accessible
     directory in your server.

  2. Edit the Makefile and change ICONDIR to point to this URL.

  3. Run `make'.

  4. In the Ciao system the files are in the correct place, in other
     systems copy the files `pillow.pl' and `icon_address.pl' to a
     suitable directory so that your Prolog system will find them.
