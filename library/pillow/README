Getting the Files
-----------------

The latest version of the Package is available via anonymous
ftp from the CLIP ftp server,
    ftp://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/pub/software/pillow.tar.gz

Installation
------------

To install simply uncompress and untar the distribution in a convenient
directory. Then edit the options in Makefile to suit your system. In
particular, copy the files in the images directory to an accessible
directory in your server and change ICONDIR to point to this directory
(if you cannot do that, bear in mind that these images will have to
travel from Spain, Europe!). Also, if you will be generating cgi-bin
executables (only available in some systems) change CGIBINDIR to point
to a cgi-bin type directory where you have write access. Finally, change
SYSTEM to the Prolog system you will be using (if your system is not
listed, perhaps you can make compatibility files for it, providing the
necessary support predicates. If you do so, please send us the
changes!). If your system is SICStus 2.1, SICStus 3 or CIAO, run "make
pillow.pl". The files pillow.pl and html.pl will be generated, pillow.pl
is configured as the module `pillow', and uses html.pl. For other
systems run "make html.pl" to generate html.pl, wich includes all the
functionality of pillow.pl except the predicate fetch_url/3 (due to lack
of socket support).  If your OS does not have "make", then manually
produce pillow.pl from pillow0.pl and the appropriate pillow_*
compatibility file, and html.pl from html0.pl and the appropriate html_*
compatibility file, changing <ICONDIR> and <CGIBINDIR> in the code to
the correct values.

Manual
------

There is no manual available for this beta version, but an article (in
ps and html versions) is included which explains the functionality of
most of the library, also accesible on-line from
   http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/miscdocs/pillow/pillow.html
The manual for the previous version of html.pl can be accessed on-line from
   http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/miscdocs/html_pl/html_pl.html

Mentioning this work

If you find this package useful and develop an application with it,
we would appreciate if you mention our work by citing the article
below and/or by putting a pointer to our WWW pages on PiLLoW
http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/miscdocs/pillow/pillow.html (easily
achieved by including a `pr' HTML term in the pages!).
